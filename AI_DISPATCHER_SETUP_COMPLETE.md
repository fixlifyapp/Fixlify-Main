# 🚀 AI DISPATCHER SETUP COMPLETE

## ✅ What I've Fixed

### 1. **MCP Appointment Server Deployed** (v7)
- URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server`
- Provides 4 essential tools for the AI:
  - `check_availability` - Check appointment slots
  - `book_appointment` - Schedule appointments  
  - `get_business_hours` - Provide hours info
  - `transfer_to_human` - Transfer to agent

### 2. **Dynamic Variables Webhook** (Already existed)
- URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
- Provides personalization variables for each call

### 3. **Database Updates**
- Added `created_via` column to appointments table
- Added indexes for better performance

## 🔧 What YOU Need to Do in Telnyx Portal

### Step 1: Open Telnyx Portal
1. Go to: https://portal.telnyx.com
2. Navigate to: **AI > AI Assistants**
3. Find and click on your assistant (ID: `assistant-2a8a396c-e975-4ea5-90bf-3297f1350775`)

### Step 2: Update Instructions
1. Click **Edit Assistant**
2. Find the **Instructions** field
3. Replace ALL existing instructions with the content from: `TELNYX_AI_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
4. This ensures the AI never goes silent and knows how to handle conversations

### Step 3: Add MCP Server
1. In the same edit screen, find **Tools** or **MCP Servers** section
2. Click **Add MCP Server** or **Add Tool**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: `Fixlify Appointment System MCP`
   - **URL**: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server`
4. Save the MCP server

### Step 4: Verify Dynamic Variables Webhook
1. Check that **Dynamic Variables Webhook** is set to:
   - `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
2. If not, update it

### Step 5: Save Everything
1. Click **Save** on the AI Assistant
2. Wait for it to update (may take 30 seconds)

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Quick Test in Browser Console:
Run the test script: `test-ai-dispatcher-complete.js`

### Phone Test:
1. Call your number: **+1 (437) 524-9932**
2. You should hear the greeting
3. Say: "I need an appointment"
4. The AI should now respond and check availability
5. Follow the conversation to book an appointment

## 📊 Monitor Results

Check if appointments are being created:
```sql
SELECT * FROM appointments 
WHERE created_via = 'ai_dispatcher' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🎯 Why It Wasn't Working

The AI was going silent because:
1. ❌ It only had Dynamic Variables (greeting worked)
2. ❌ It didn't have MCP Tools (couldn't continue conversation)
3. ✅ Now it has BOTH - full conversation capability!

## 📝 Files Created/Updated
1. `TELNYX_AI_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - Instructions for Telnyx AI Assistant
2. `test-ai-dispatcher-complete.js` - Test script for verification
3. `mcp-appointment-server` edge function - Provides conversation tools

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check MCP Server is responding:**
   - Run the test script in browser console
   - Should see 4 tools listed

2. **Check Dynamic Variables:**
   - Webhook should return company info
   - Test with the script

3. **In Telnyx Portal:**
   - Make sure both webhook URLs are correct
   - Instructions are updated
   - AI Assistant is "Active" status

4. **Common Issues:**
   - If greeting works but then silence = MCP not connected
   - If no greeting at all = Dynamic Variables issue
   - If transfer fails = Check phone number routing

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When working correctly:
- AI greets with company name ✅
- AI responds to appointment requests ✅
- AI can check availability ✅
- AI can book appointments ✅
- Appointments appear in database ✅
