# ✅ CONFIRMED: Use telnyx-dynamic-variables Webhook

## THE 401 ERRORS PROVE IT:
Your logs show `ai-assistant-webhook` returning **401 Unauthorized** because:
- It requires JWT authentication
- Telnyx doesn't send JWT tokens
- That's why you see those 401 errors

## ✅ CORRECT WEBHOOK TO USE:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables
```

This webhook:
- ✅ NO authentication required
- ✅ Returns greeting_message properly
- ✅ Works with Telnyx

## ❌ DON'T USE THIS:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
```

This webhook:
- ❌ Requires JWT authentication
- ❌ Returns 401 errors
- ❌ Telnyx can't authenticate with it

## IN TELNYX SETTINGS:
Make sure you're using:
- **Webhook URL:** `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables`
- **Greeting:** `{{greeting_message}}`

## WHAT'S IN YOUR DATABASE:
```
"Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
```

## WHAT CALLERS HEAR:
```
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
```

## TEST IT:
Run `FINAL_TEST_GREETING.js` in browser console to verify the correct webhook is working.

## THE 401 ERRORS ARE EXPECTED:
Those 401 errors for ai-assistant-webhook are normal and expected. That's why we use telnyx-dynamic-variables instead!
