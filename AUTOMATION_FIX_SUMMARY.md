## Automation System Issues & Fixes

### Issues Found:
1. **Emails sending twice** - Automation being processed multiple times
2. **Variables not replaced** - {{job.scheduledDate}}, {{job.scheduledTime}}, {{job.technician}} showing as raw text
3. **SMS failing** - Telnyx configuration or data issues

### Root Causes:
1. **Duplicate Processing**: The automation processor might be picking up the same log multiple times
2. **Variable Resolution**: The edge function is not properly formatting job data with expected variable names
3. **Missing Data**: Jobs might not have technician assigned or schedule times

### Fixes to Apply:

#### 1. Fix Variable Replacement in Edge Function
The enrichContext function needs to properly format job data with the expected variable names:
- `job.scheduledDate` - Format from schedule_start
- `job.scheduledTime` - Format from schedule_start  
- `job.technician` - Get from technician relationship
- `client.firstName` - Get from client first_name or parse from name

#### 2. Prevent Duplicate Processing
Add better duplicate detection in the automation processor:
- Check if log was already processed in last 30 seconds
- Use database locks to prevent concurrent processing
- Add unique constraint on execution logs

#### 3. Fix SMS Issues
- Ensure phone numbers are properly formatted
- Check Telnyx API keys are configured
- Validate recipient phone numbers

### Testing:
1. Create a job with all required fields (technician, schedule times, client)
2. Change status to completed
3. Verify only ONE email and ONE SMS sent
4. Check that all variables are replaced with actual values
