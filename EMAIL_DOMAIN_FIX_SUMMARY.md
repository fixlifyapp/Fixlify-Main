# Email Domain Fix Summary - Fixlify

## Issue Analysis
Based on the provided analysis, the email system was failing because:
- Emails were being sent from `mg.fixlify.com` domain
- But Mailgun was configured for `fixlify.app` domain
- This domain mismatch caused Mailgun to reject emails

## Code Review Results

### ✅ Edge Functions Status

1. **mailgun-email** (`/supabase/functions/mailgun-email/index.ts`)
   - Already uses `fixlify.app` as default domain
   - Gets domain from `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` env var with fallback to `fixlify.app`
   - Status: **CORRECT**

2. **send-estimate** (`/supabase/functions/send-estimate/index.ts`)
   - Uses user's `company_email` with fallback to `noreply@fixlify.app`
   - Calls mailgun-email edge function for sending
   - Status: **CORRECT**

3. **send-invoice** (`/supabase/functions/send-invoice/index.ts`)
   - Uses user's `company_email` with fallback to `noreply@fixlify.app`
   - Calls mailgun-email edge function for sending
   - Status: **CORRECT**

4. **check-email-config** (`/supabase/functions/check-email-config/index.ts`)
   - Had outdated references to `mg.fixlify.com`
   - Status: **UPDATED** ✓

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `check-email-config` function to use correct domain references
2. Verified all edge functions are using `fixlify.app` domain
3. Created complete send-estimate function code in verification folder

## Root Cause
The issue was likely that the `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` environment variable in Supabase was set to `mg.fixlify.com` instead of `fixlify.app`. The code itself was already correct.

## Solution

### 1. Add Environment Variable
Add this to Supabase Edge Function secrets:
```
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=fixlify.app
```

### 2. Deploy Updated Functions
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy mailgun-email --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy send-estimate
npx supabase functions deploy send-invoice
npx supabase functions deploy check-email-config
```

## Email Strategy Explained

The system is designed to work as follows:
- **Main Domain**: `fixlify.app` (not a subdomain)
- **User Emails**: Each user has their own company email (e.g., `fixlifyservices@fixlify.app`)
- **From Address**: Emails are sent FROM the user's company email address
- **Fallback**: If no company email is set, falls back to `noreply@fixlify.app`

## Important Notes

1. The code shows `fixlify.app` as the correct domain throughout
2. The issue mentioned `mg.fixlify.com` was being used, suggesting the problem was in the environment variable configuration
3. Do NOT set `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL` - the system uses each user's company email
4. Make sure DNS records are properly configured for `fixlify.app` in Mailgun

## Files Created
- `/email-domain-verification/verification-summary.js` - Domain configuration summary
- `/email-domain-verification/send-estimate-complete.ts` - Complete edge function code

The email functionality should now work correctly once the `MAILGUN_DOMAIN=fixlify.app` is added to Supabase secrets!
