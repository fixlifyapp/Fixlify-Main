# HOW TO FIX YOUR AI DISPATCHER - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## The Issue:
Your AI says the greeting then stops because it doesn't know it has tools available to continue the conversation.

## The Fix - 3 Steps:

### STEP 1: Add MCP Server in Telnyx

1. Go to your Telnyx AI Assistant settings
2. Find the **"MCP Servers"** section (might be under Tools or Integrations)
3. Click **"Add MCP Server"**
4. Configure it exactly like this:

**Server Name:** 
```
Appointment Tools
```

**Server URL:**
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server
```

**Authentication:** 
```
None (or leave empty)
```

5. Click **Save**

### STEP 2: Update AI Instructions

1. In your AI Assistant settings, find the **Instructions** field
2. DELETE everything currently there
3. Copy ALL the text from `TELNYX_COMPLETE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
4. Paste it into the Instructions field
5. Click **Save**

### STEP 3: Verify Both Components

Make sure you have:
1. **Dynamic Variables Webhook URL** (for greeting/personalization):
   ```
   https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
   ```

2. **MCP Server URL** (for tools/actions):
   ```
   https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server
   ```

## Test Your Fix:

Call your number and test these scenarios:

1. **Say:** "Hello"
   - **Expected:** AI gives personalized greeting

2. **Say:** "I need to schedule an appointment"
   - **Expected:** AI says "Let me check availability" and lists times

3. **Say:** "2 PM works for me"
   - **Expected:** AI books the appointment and gives confirmation number

## Why It Wasn't Working:

1. **Dynamic Variables Webhook** ✅ Was working - provided greeting
2. **MCP Server** ✅ Was deployed but ❌ NOT configured in Telnyx
3. **Instructions** ❌ Didn't tell AI about available tools

## Alternative: If MCP Server doesn't work, use Webhook Tools

If Telnyx doesn't support MCP Servers in your plan, add as Webhook Tools instead:

### Tool 1: Check Availability
- **Name:** check_availability
- **URL:** https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server
- **Method:** POST
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "tool": "check_availability",
    "date": "{{date}}"
  }
  ```

### Tool 2: Book Appointment
- **Name:** book_appointment
- **URL:** https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server
- **Method:** POST
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "tool": "book_appointment",
    "customer_name": "{{customer_name}}",
    "customer_phone": "{{customer_phone}}",
    "date": "{{date}}",
    "time": "{{time}}",
    "service_type": "{{service_type}}"
  }
  ```

## Status of Components:

✅ **ai-assistant-webhook** v27 - Working, provides variables
✅ **mcp-appointment-server** v5 - Deployed with full logging
❌ **Telnyx Configuration** - Needs MCP Server added
❌ **Instructions** - Needs update with tool awareness

Once you add the MCP Server and update instructions, your AI will work!
