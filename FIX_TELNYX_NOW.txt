# ðŸš¨ URGENT: FIX TELNYX AI ASSISTANT - STEP BY STEP

## THE PROBLEM
Your AI Assistant says the greeting then goes completely silent. This is a Telnyx configuration issue.

## SOLUTION - FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:

### Step 1: Log into Telnyx Portal
1. Go to: https://portal.telnyx.com
2. Log in with your credentials

### Step 2: Navigate to AI Assistants
1. Click on "AI" in the left sidebar
2. Click on "AI Assistants"
3. Find your assistant (should show phone number +14375249932)

### Step 3: Edit Your AI Assistant
1. Click on your assistant name or the Edit button
2. You should see assistant ID: assistant-2a8a396c-e975-4ea5-90bf-3297f1350775

### Step 4: UPDATE THE INSTRUCTIONS FIELD
1. Find the "Instructions" or "System Prompt" field
2. DELETE everything that's currently there
3. Copy ALL the text from the file: TELNYX_COMPLETE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
4. Paste it into the Instructions field

### Step 5: VERIFY WEBHOOK SETTINGS
In the same assistant settings, check:

1. **Webhook URL** must be EXACTLY:
   ```
   https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
   ```

2. **Webhook Method**: POST

3. **Enable these webhook events** (if options exist):
   - âœ… Call started
   - âœ… Call initialization
   - âœ… Assistant initialization

4. **Webhook Timeout**: Set to 3000ms (3 seconds) if configurable

### Step 6: VOICE SETTINGS
Make sure these are set:
1. **Voice**: Alloy (or any available voice)
2. **Language**: English
3. **Temperature**: 0.7
4. **Turn Detection**: Enabled

### Step 7: SAVE CHANGES
1. Click "Save" or "Update Assistant"
2. Wait for confirmation that changes are saved

### Step 8: TEST YOUR SETUP
1. Call +14375249932 from your phone
2. The AI should:
   - Say the greeting
   - IMMEDIATELY ask "What can I help you with today?"
   - Continue responding to everything you say
   - Never go silent

## IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:

### Option A: Disable Dynamic Variables (Temporary Fix)
1. In Telnyx Assistant settings
2. Look for "Dynamic Variables" or "Use Webhook for Variables"
3. Turn it OFF/Disable it
4. Add a simple greeting directly in Instructions:
   ```
   Start every call by saying: "Thank you for calling Nick's Appliance Repair. I'm Sarah, your AI assistant. What can I help you with today?"
   ```

### Option B: Check MCP Server Settings
1. In Telnyx, look for "MCP Servers" or "Tools"
2. If there's an MCP server configured, try DISABLING it temporarily
3. MCP servers can sometimes interfere with response flow

### Option C: Create a New AI Assistant (Nuclear Option)
If nothing works:
1. Create a brand new AI Assistant in Telnyx
2. Use ONLY the instructions from TELNYX_COMPLETE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
3. Don't add webhook initially - test without it first
4. Once working, add webhook URL

## CRITICAL SETTINGS TO CHECK:
- âœ… Instructions field has the complete text (no {{variables}})
- âœ… Webhook URL is exactly correct (no trailing slashes)
- âœ… Voice is set (not "none" or empty)
- âœ… Turn detection is enabled
- âœ… No conflicting MCP servers

## TEST PHRASES TO TRY:
1. "Hello" - Should get immediate response
2. Stay silent - Should hear "Are you still there?" after 3 seconds
3. "I need service" - Should ask what type
4. "What's your price?" - Should quote $75 diagnostic

## CONTACT SUPPORT IF NEEDED:
If the AI still goes silent after greeting:
1. Contact Telnyx Support
2. Tell them: "AI Assistant says greeting then goes silent, not responding to any input"
3. Ask them to check if webhook response is being processed correctly
4. Reference Assistant ID: assistant-2a8a396c-e975-4ea5-90bf-3297f1350775

The key issue is that Telnyx needs EXPLICIT instructions in their UI.
The webhook provides variables but Telnyx needs the conversation logic in Instructions field!
