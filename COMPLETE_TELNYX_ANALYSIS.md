# üìã TELNYX GREETING ISSUE - COMPLETE ANALYSIS

## WHAT YOU REPORTED:
- First call: Says literal word "greeting"
- Second call: Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't
- Third call: Back to saying "greeting"

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
**JWT Authentication is blocking Telnyx from accessing the webhook**

### Why this happens:
1. Supabase Edge Functions require JWT authentication by default
2. Telnyx doesn't have your JWT tokens (and can't get them)
3. When Telnyx calls the webhook, it gets: **401 Unauthorized**
4. Telnyx can't get the variables, so it says "greeting" literally

### Evidence from logs:
```
POST | 401 | https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables
execution_time_ms: 86
status_code: 401
```

## THE WEBHOOK CODE IS CORRECT:
‚úÖ Returns `{{greeting}}` variable  
‚úÖ Processes templates (no `{{company_name}}` in output)  
‚úÖ Returns all required variables  
‚úÖ No caching issues  

## THE ONLY PROBLEM:
‚ùå JWT verification (`verify_jwt: true`) is blocking access

## SOLUTION - YOU MUST DO THIS MANUALLY:

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Edge Functions**
4. Click on `telnyx-dynamic-variables`
5. Find **JWT Verification** setting
6. **TURN IT OFF**
7. Save

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI (If you have it)
1. Create `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[functions.telnyx-dynamic-variables]
verify_jwt = false
```
2. Run: `supabase functions deploy telnyx-dynamic-variables`

## AFTER FIXING:
Your Telnyx configuration will work:
- Webhook: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables`
- Greeting: `{{greeting}}`
- All variables will work

## TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
Until you disable JWT verification, use a static greeting in Telnyx:
```
Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?
```

## FILES CREATED FOR YOU:
1. `FIX_TELNYX_NOW.md` - Quick fix instructions
2. `CRITICAL_JWT_ISSUE.md` - Detailed problem explanation
3. `test-all-variables.js` - Test script for browser console
4. `TELNYX_WEBHOOK_COMPLETE.md` - Full documentation

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
I cannot disable JWT verification through the API - this is a Supabase platform limitation. You must do it manually through the dashboard or CLI.

**Status:** Waiting for you to disable JWT verification in Supabase Dashboard
**Once done:** Telnyx will work perfectly with all dynamic variables
