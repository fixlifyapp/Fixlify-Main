## 📞 HOW IT WORKS:

1. **Call comes in** → Telnyx sends caller's phone to webhook
2. **Webhook checks database** → Searches clients by phone number
3. **If customer exists** → Gets their name, history, balance
4. **Returns all variables** → Telnyx replaces {{variables}} in real-time
5. **AI speaks** → Uses personalized information
