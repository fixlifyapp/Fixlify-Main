# AI Dispatcher Webhook Issues - FIXED

## Problem
Sometimes AI says "Greetings" instead of personalized greeting from webhook

## Root Causes
1. **Webhook Timeout** - Telnyx has ~3 second timeout
2. **Slow Database Queries** - Client lookup sometimes slow
3. **Inconsistent Calls** - Telnyx doesn't always call webhook

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Timeout Protection
```javascript
// Webhook now races between:
// - Main processing (database lookups)
// - 2.8 second timeout (returns default greeting)
Promise.race([processPromise, timeoutPromise])
```

### 2. Optimized Queries
- Indexed phone number lookups
- Reduced query complexity
- Parallel data fetching

### 3. Fallback Greeting
If timeout occurs, returns generic but professional greeting instead of "Greetings"

## Testing
Run speed test:
```bash
node test-webhook-speed.js
```

## Monitoring
Check webhook logs:
```sql
SELECT 
  created_at,
  response_body->'dynamic_variables'->>'greeting' as greeting,
  request_body->'data'->>'from' as caller
FROM webhook_logs 
WHERE webhook_name = 'ai-assistant-webhook'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Telnyx Configuration
Ensure in Telnyx AI Assistant:
1. Dynamic Variables Webhook URL is set
2. URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
3. No caching enabled
4. Timeout set to 5 seconds (if configurable)

## Status
✅ Deployed optimized webhook with timeout protection
✅ Response guaranteed within 2.8 seconds
✅ Professional fallback greeting if timeout
