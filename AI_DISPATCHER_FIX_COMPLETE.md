# HOW TO FIX AI DISPATCHER - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## The Problem:
Your AI says the greeting and then goes silent because it doesn't have tools to continue the conversation.

## The Solution:
You need to add BOTH:
1. ✅ Dynamic Variables Webhook (already working)
2. ❌ MCP Server for Tools (needs to be added)

## Step 1: Update Telnyx AI Assistant Instructions

Copy this to your Telnyx AI Assistant Instructions field:

```
You are {{agent_name}} for {{company_name}}, an {{business_niche}} specialist.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER BE SILENT - Always respond to the customer
2. Start with: "{{greeting}}"
3. If you don't understand, ask them to repeat
4. Use available tools to help customers

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- check_availability: Check available appointment slots
- book_appointment: Schedule an appointment
- get_business_hours: Provide business hours
- transfer_to_human: Transfer to human agent

CONVERSATION FLOW:
1. Greet using {{greeting}}
2. Listen to their request
3. If they want an appointment:
   - Use check_availability tool to show slots
   - Use book_appointment tool to schedule
4. If they ask about hours:
   - Use get_business_hours tool
5. If you can't help:
   - Use transfer_to_human tool

SERVICES: {{services_offered}}
HOURS: {{hours_of_operation}}
DIAGNOSTIC FEE: {{diagnostic_fee}}

For existing customers ({{is_existing_customer}} = true):
- Address them as {{customer_name}}
- Reference their history: {{customer_history}}

SAMPLE INTERACTIONS:
Customer: "I need service"
You: "I'd be happy to help! Let me check our available appointments. What type of service do you need?"
[Use check_availability tool]

Customer: "Book me for tomorrow at 2 PM"
You: "Let me book that for you."
[Use book_appointment tool with their details]
```

## Step 2: Add MCP Server in Telnyx

1. In your Telnyx AI Assistant settings
2. Find the "MCP Servers" section
3. Click "Add MCP server"
4. Enter these details:
   - **Name**: Fixlify Appointment System MCP
   - **URL**: https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server
   - **Description**: Appointment scheduling and management tools
5. Click "Save"

## Step 3: Verify Both Components

Make sure you have:
- ✅ Dynamic Variables Webhook URL: 
  `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
- ✅ MCP Server URL:
  `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-appointment-server`

## Step 4: Test Your AI

Call your number and test these scenarios:
1. "Hello" - Should get personalized greeting
2. "I need to schedule an appointment" - Should offer available slots
3. "What are your hours?" - Should provide business hours
4. "Book me for tomorrow at 2 PM" - Should book appointment

## What Each Component Does:

**Dynamic Variables Webhook (ai-assistant-webhook)**:
- Provides greeting, company info, customer data
- Recognizes existing customers
- Supplies all {{variables}} for personalization

**MCP Server (mcp-appointment-server)**:
- Provides tools the AI can use
- Handles appointment scheduling
- Manages availability checking
- Enables call transfers

## Deployed Functions:
- ✅ ai-assistant-webhook v27 - Working
- ✅ mcp-appointment-server v3 - Just deployed

Both are required for the AI to work properly!
