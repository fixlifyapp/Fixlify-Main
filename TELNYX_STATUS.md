# ✅ YOUR TELNYX AI DISPATCHER IS WORKING!

## 📊 Current Status:
- **Webhook Status**: ✅ ACTIVE & RECEIVING CALLS
- **Last Call**: Today at 17:35 UTC
- **Company Data**: Loading correctly
- **Dynamic Variables**: Being sent to Telnyx

## 🎯 Your Configuration:
```
Webhook URL: https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
Company: Nicks appliance repair
Agent: Sarah
Services: Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Oven
```

## 📍 Where to Set in Telnyx Portal:

### NOT HERE ❌:
- Tools section
- Webhook Tools
- Add Webhook Tool

### SET IT HERE ✅:
Look in your AI Assistant's MAIN configuration page for:
- **"Dynamic Variables Webhook URL"**
- **"Variables Webhook"** 
- **"Webhook URL"**
- **"Dynamic Variables"** section

It's usually near:
- Assistant Name
- Instructions
- Greeting Message
- Voice Settings

## 🧪 Verify It's Working:
When someone calls +1 (437) 524-9932, the AI should say:
> "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"

Instead of a generic greeting.

## 📝 What Happens:
1. Call comes in → Telnyx gets the call
2. Telnyx calls your webhook → Gets company info
3. AI uses the info → Personalized greeting
4. Customer hears → "Nicks appliance repair" not "our company"

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Find the Dynamic Variables field in Telnyx
2. Enter the webhook URL
3. Save the configuration
4. Test with a call

The backend is working perfectly - just need to connect it in Telnyx!
