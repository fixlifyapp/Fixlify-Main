TIPS FOR USING AGENTS:
- Start with 'think' for quick tasks
- Use 'think hard' for complex problems  
- Use 'ultrathink' for architectural decisions
- Run agents in parallel with 'Task()' for speed
- Agents automatically coordinate when needed
- Each agent has specialized knowledge of Fixlify

EXAMPLE USAGE IN CLAUDE CODE:
Just type or copy-paste any of the commands above!

The agents will:
1. Analyze the request
2. Coordinate if needed
3. Execute the task
4. Provide detailed output
5. Make actual code changes

Remember: These aren't just analyzers - they write production code!
