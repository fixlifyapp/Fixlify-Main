# üö® SOLUTION: Fix Telnyx "greeting" Issue

## THE ROOT CAUSE:
All Supabase Edge Functions have JWT verification enabled by default. Telnyx can't authenticate, so it gets blocked and says "greeting" literally.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - DO THIS NOW:

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Edge Functions** in the left menu
4. Find `telnyx-dynamic-variables`

### Step 2: Disable JWT Verification
1. Click on the function name
2. Click **Settings** or **Edit**
3. Find **"Require JWT Verification"** or **"verify_jwt"**
4. **DISABLE IT** (turn it OFF)
5. Save changes

### Step 3: Update Telnyx
Use this webhook URL in Telnyx:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables
```

## ALTERNATIVE: Create Local Config
If you have Supabase CLI installed locally:

1. Create file `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[functions.telnyx-dynamic-variables]
verify_jwt = false
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
supabase functions deploy telnyx-dynamic-variables
```

## TEST THE FIX:
After disabling JWT verification, test by calling your Telnyx number. You should hear:
```
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
```

## IF STILL NOT WORKING:
Use this static greeting in Telnyx for now:
```
Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?
```

## STATUS: 
‚úÖ Webhook code is correct
‚ùå JWT verification is blocking Telnyx
