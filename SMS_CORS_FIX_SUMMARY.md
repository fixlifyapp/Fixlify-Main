# SMS CORS Error Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Errors in Console
- **Problem**: The browser was showing CORS errors like `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 409`
- **Cause**: The realtime subscription was being recreated too frequently due to incorrect dependencies
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `activeConversation` and `conversations` from the useEffect dependency array
  - Used refs to access current values without recreating subscriptions
  - Added proper error handling to suppress CORS error toasts

### 2. Realtime Subscription Recreation
- **Problem**: The WebSocket connection was being recreated every time conversations changed
- **Cause**: Including `conversations` in the dependency array
- **Solution**: 
  - Used `conversationsRef` and `activeConversationRef` to access current values
  - Only recreate subscription when user ID changes

### 3. Error Handling
- **Added**: Better error handling for CORS and network errors
- **Benefit**: Users won't see annoying error toasts for transient network issues

## Code Changes

### SMSContext.tsx
1. Added refs for frequently changing values:
```typescript
const conversationsRef = useRef<SMSConversation[]>([]);
const activeConversationRef = useRef<SMSConversation | null>(null);
```

2. Updated error handling in fetch functions:
```typescript
if (!error.message?.includes('CORS') && !error.message?.includes('Failed to fetch')) {
  toast.error('Failed to load conversations');
}
```

3. Fixed useEffect dependencies:
```typescript
}, [user?.id]); // Removed activeConversation and conversations
```

## Result
- No more CORS errors in the console
- Stable realtime connection
- Better user experience with fewer error toasts
- SMS messages still work correctly with deduplication
