## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS:

### 1. Phone Call Comes In
```
Customer calls +14375249932
```

### 2. Webhook Gets Configuration
```javascript
// Webhook checks database for this phone number's config
SELECT * FROM ai_dispatcher_configs 
WHERE phone_number_id = [phone's ID]
```

### 3. Builds Dynamic Response
```javascript
{
  greeting: "Thank you for calling Cool Air Pros. I'm Sarah. How can I help with your HVAC needs today?",
  business_niche: "HVAC Services",
  company_name: "Cool Air Pros",
  services_offered: "AC repair, Heating, Ventilation, Maintenance",
  additional_info: "Diagnostic $95 • Emergency +$75 • 1-year warranty",
  // ... all other variables
}
```

### 4. Telnyx Uses Variables
The AI uses these variables in its conversation:
- Knows it's an HVAC company
- Quotes correct prices
- Offers appropriate services
- Behaves according to personality

  agent_name = 'Mike',
  services_offered = 'Mowing, Trimming, Fertilization, Irrigation, Design',
  hours_of_operation = 'Mon-Sat 7am-6pm',
  diagnostic_fee = NULL,  -- No diagnostic for landscaping
  additional_info = 'Free estimates • Weekly/Monthly plans • Spring special 20% off',
  greeting_message = 'Thanks for calling {{company_name}}. I''m {{agent_name}}. How can we beautify your lawn today?',
  agent_personality = 'Friendly, knowledgeable about plants, helpful with seasonal advice'
