# Job Status Update - Duplicate Toast Fix

## 🎯 **Issue**
You were seeing two toast notifications when updating job status:
- ✅ Green success toast: "Status updated to Cancelled"
- ❌ Red error toast: "Failed to update job status"

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
Multiple components were trying to show toast notifications for the same status update:

1. **JobStatusBadge** → Showed success/error toasts
2. **JobDetailsHeader** → Showed success/error toasts  
3. **useJobStatusUpdate** → Also showed success/error toasts

This created a race condition where multiple toasts appeared.

## ✅ **Solution**
I removed duplicate toast notifications from:
- **JobStatusBadge** - Removed both success and error toasts
- **JobDetailsHeader** - Removed both success and error toasts

Now only **useJobStatusUpdate** (the actual update logic) shows toasts.

## 📋 **Changes Made**

### 1. JobStatusBadge.tsx
- Removed `toast.success()` and `toast.error()` calls
- Removed `import { toast } from "sonner"`
- Added comments explaining toasts are handled elsewhere

### 2. JobDetailsHeader.tsx  
- Removed `toast.success()` and `toast.error()` calls
- Removed `import { toast } from "sonner"`
- Added comments explaining toasts are handled elsewhere

### 3. useJobStatusUpdate.ts
- Kept toast notifications (this is the single source of truth)
- Added better status normalization to prevent duplicate updates

## 🧪 **Testing**
1. Change any job status
2. You should see **only ONE toast** notification
3. If successful: Green toast "Job status updated to [status]"
4. If failed: Red toast with error message

## 🎯 **Result**
- No more duplicate toasts
- Clean, single notification per status update
- Better user experience

The status update system now follows the "single responsibility" principle - only the hook that actually performs the update shows notifications!
