# 🎯 FINAL STATUS: TELNYX GREETING CONFIGURATION

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
1. **Webhook URL:** `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables`
2. **Returns:** `{{greeting}}` variable with PROCESSED text (no templates inside)
3. **All variables** for your prompt are included

## 📝 YOUR CONFIGURATION:
```
In Telnyx:
- Greeting: {{greeting}}
- Dynamic Variables Webhook: [URL above]
```

## 🔊 WHAT CALLERS HEAR:
```
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
```

## ⚠️ THE "GREETING" ISSUE:
**Problem:** First call might say literal word "greeting"
**Cause:** Telnyx timing - plays audio before webhook responds
**Solution:** Add 1-2 second delay in Telnyx before greeting

## 📊 VARIABLES FOR YOUR PROMPT:
All these work in your Telnyx prompt:
- {{agent_name}} → "Sarah"
- {{company_name}} → "Nicks appliance repair"
- {{business_niche}} → "Appliance Repair"
- {{diagnostic_fee}} → "$89"
- {{services_offered}} → Full list of services
- {{hours_of_operation}} → Business hours
- {{is_existing_customer}} → true/false
- {{customer_name}} → Customer's name if recognized
- And all others...

## 🧪 TEST FILES:
- `test-all-variables.js` - Verify all variables work
- `TELNYX_WEBHOOK_COMPLETE.md` - Full documentation
- `FIX_GREETING_TIMING_ISSUE.md` - Fix for "greeting" word issue

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURED CORRECTLY!
The only issue is the Telnyx timing on first call. Add a delay in Telnyx to fix it.
