# ✅ TELNYX AI ASSISTANT - FINAL SETUP CHECKLIST

## 📝 YOUR COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS (Copy & Paste):
Located in: `TELNYX_AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`

## 🔧 YOUR WEBHOOK URL:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
```

## 📍 WHERE TO PUT EVERYTHING IN TELNYX:

### Step 1: Instructions
1. Go to your AI Assistant in Telnyx
2. Find "Instructions" or "System Prompt" field
3. Copy entire content from `TELNYX_AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
4. Paste it there
5. Save

### Step 2: Dynamic Variables Webhook
Look for ONE of these fields:
- "Dynamic Variables Webhook URL"
- "Variables Webhook URL"
- "Webhook Configuration"
- "Dynamic Variables" section

Enter: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`

### Step 3: If You Can't Find Dynamic Variables Field
Add it as a Tool instead:
- Click "Add Tool" or "Webhook Tool"
- Name: `initialize_company_data`
- URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
- Method: POST
- Description: "Get company information at start of call"

Then add to TOP of instructions:
```
FIRST ACTION: Always call initialize_company_data tool immediately when call starts to get company information.
```

## 🧪 TEST YOUR SETUP:

### Make a Test Call:
1. Call +1 (437) 524-9932
2. You should hear: "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah..."
3. NOT: "Thank you for calling {{company_name}}..."

### What Success Looks Like:
✅ "I'm Sarah from Nicks appliance repair"
❌ "I'm {{agent_name}} from {{company_name}}"

## 🎯 WHAT THE VARIABLES WILL BECOME:
- {{company_name}} → "Nicks appliance repair"
- {{agent_name}} → "Sarah"  
- {{business_type}} → "Appliance Repair"
- {{services_offered}} → "Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Oven"
- {{diagnostic_fee}} → "75"
- {{emergency_surcharge}} → "50"
- {{hours_of_operation}} → "Monday-Friday 9am-6pm"
- {{service_area}} → "Greater Toronto Area"
- {{business_phone}} → "+14375249932"
- {{warranty_info}} → "90-day warranty on all repairs"

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES:

### Issue: Still hearing "{{company_name}}"
**Fix**: Webhook URL not set in right place or not being called

### Issue: Generic greeting
**Fix**: Instructions not using variables, just hardcoded text

### Issue: No personalization for repeat callers
**Fix**: That's normal unless you have conversation history enabled

## 💡 QUICK FIX:
If variables aren't working after trying everything, just replace them manually:
- Change `{{company_name}}` to `Nicks appliance repair`
- Change `{{agent_name}}` to `Sarah`
- etc.

## 📊 TO CHECK IF WEBHOOK IS BEING CALLED:
After making a test call, check logs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM webhook_logs 
WHERE webhook_name LIKE '%ai%' 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
