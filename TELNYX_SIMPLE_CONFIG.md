## IF YOU WANT DYNAMIC VARIABLES TO WORK:

The webhook needs to be called BEFORE the greeting. In Telnyx, this would require:

1. The Webhook Tool to be set as "Run on call initialization"
2. OR the Dynamic Variables URL to be properly configured with authentication

But since Telnyx isn't calling the webhook, the simplest solution is to NOT use variables at all - just put the actual text directly in the fields.
