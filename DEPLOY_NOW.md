# ðŸš€ DEPLOY SMS/EMAIL SCHEMA NOW

## Quick Steps:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod/sql/new

2. **Copy and paste the ENTIRE content** of:
   `DEPLOY_SMS_EMAIL_SCHEMA_COMPLETE.sql`

3. **Click "Run" button**

4. **Check the output** - you should see:
   - "Deployment Complete!"
   - List of 4 created tables

## That's it! 

Once you confirm the deployment worked, I'll immediately start Phase 2 - creating the SMS edge function.
