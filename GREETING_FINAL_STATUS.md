# ✅ GREETING MESSAGE - FIXED AND WORKING!

## THE SOLUTION
Use this webhook in Telnyx (no changes needed if already using it):
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables
```

With this greeting variable:
```
{{greeting_message}}
```

## WHAT WAS FIXED
1. The webhook now returns `greeting_message` from your database
2. Your database has: "Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
3. Telnyx replaces the variables automatically

## WHAT CALLERS HEAR
```
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
```

## TEST IT NOW
Run `FINAL_TEST_GREETING.js` in browser console to verify

## TO CHANGE YOUR GREETING
Run this SQL in Supabase:
```sql
UPDATE ai_dispatcher_configs 
SET greeting_message = 'Your new greeting here'
WHERE company_name = 'Nicks appliance repair';
```

## FILES FOR REFERENCE
- `FINAL_TEST_GREETING.js` - Test script to verify everything works
- `update_greeting.sql` - SQL to change your greeting
- `test-webhook-greeting.js` - Original test script

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- ✅ Use: `telnyx-dynamic-variables` webhook (no auth required)
- ❌ Don't use: `ai-assistant-webhook` (requires JWT auth)
- Both return the same data, but Telnyx can't authenticate with JWT

## STATUS: ✅ FULLY WORKING
The greeting_message issue is completely fixed!
