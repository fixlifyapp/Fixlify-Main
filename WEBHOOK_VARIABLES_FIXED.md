# ✅ WEBHOOK FIXED - ALL VARIABLES NOW WORKING

## THE PROBLEM WAS:
The webhook was returning:
```json
{
  "greeting": "Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}...",
  "company_name": "Nicks appliance repair",
  "agent_name": "Sarah",
  "diagnostic_fee": "89"  // Missing $
}
```

The greeting had {{templates}} inside it! Telnyx can't process nested templates.

## NOW FIXED TO RETURN:
```json
{
  "greeting": "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?",
  "company_name": "Nicks appliance repair",
  "agent_name": "Sarah",
  "diagnostic_fee": "$89"  // Added $
}
```

## ALL VARIABLES FOR YOUR PROMPT:

✅ **{{greeting}}** = Fully processed greeting (no templates)
✅ **{{agent_name}}** = "Sarah"
✅ **{{company_name}}** = "Nicks appliance repair"
✅ **{{business_niche}}** = "Appliance Repair"
✅ **{{services_offered}}** = "Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Oven, Stove, Microwave"
✅ **{{hours_of_operation}}** = "Monday-Friday 9am-6pm, Saturday 10am-4pm"
✅ **{{diagnostic_fee}}** = "$89" (with $ sign)
✅ **{{additional_info}}** = "90-day warranty on all repairs • Senior discount 10% • Emergency service +$50"
✅ **{{is_existing_customer}}** = "true" or "false"
✅ **{{customer_name}}** = Customer's first name if found
✅ **{{customer_history}}** = Recent jobs if existing customer
✅ **{{outstanding_balance}}** = "$0" or actual balance
✅ **{{call_transfer_message}}** = "Let me transfer you to a specialist who can better assist you with that."
✅ **{{agent_personality}}** = AI behavior instructions
✅ **{{ai_capabilities}}** = What the AI can do

## TEST THE FIX:

### Quick Browser Test:
```javascript
// Run in F12 console
fetch('https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    data: {
      payload: {
        telnyx_agent_target: "+14375249932",
        telnyx_end_user_target: "+15551234567"
      }
    }
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(data => {
  console.log('GREETING:', data.dynamic_variables.greeting);
  console.log('All variables:', data.dynamic_variables);
});
```

### Expected Response:
```
GREETING: Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?
```

## YOUR TELNYX PROMPT WILL NOW WORK:

When Telnyx calls the webhook, it receives:
- ✅ Greeting without templates
- ✅ All variables properly formatted
- ✅ Diagnostic fee with $ sign
- ✅ Customer lookup working

The AI will now properly:
1. Introduce itself as Sarah from Nicks appliance repair
2. Use the diagnostic fee of $89
3. Know the services offered
4. Follow the personality guidelines
5. Transfer calls when needed

## VERIFICATION:

Check the latest webhook response:
```sql
SELECT 
  response_body->'dynamic_variables'->>'greeting' as greeting,
  response_body->'dynamic_variables'->>'diagnostic_fee' as fee,
  response_body->'dynamic_variables'->>'company_name' as company,
  response_body->'dynamic_variables'->>'agent_name' as agent
FROM webhook_logs
WHERE webhook_name = 'ai-assistant-webhook'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Should return:
- greeting: "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah..."
- fee: "$89"
- company: "Nicks appliance repair"
- agent: "Sarah"

## STATUS: ✅ FIXED
All variables are now properly processed and ready for Telnyx!
