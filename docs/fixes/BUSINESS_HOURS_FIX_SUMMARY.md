# Business Hours Error Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ProfileCompanyPage Error
**Problem**: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'business_hours')
**Cause**: The component was using incorrect hook property names

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `ProfileCompanyPage.tsx` to use correct hook interface:
  - Changed `settings` → `companySettings`
  - Changed `loading` → `isLoading`
  - Changed `updateSettings` → `updateCompanySettings`
- Added null check for `companySettings` before accessing properties
- Added default empty object for business_hours: `companySettings.business_hours || {}`

### 2. Database Integrity
**Fix Applied**:
- Added migration to ensure all company_settings records have business_hours
- Set default business hours (Mon-Fri 9:00-17:00, Sat 9:00-15:00, Sun closed)
- Ensured company_timezone is set (default: America/Toronto)

### 3. Hook Safety
**Fix Applied in useCompanySettings**:
- Added automatic business_hours initialization if missing
- Ensures business_hours object is always present with proper structure
- Default business hours added when creating new company settings

### 4. Business Hours Utilities
**Created new utilities** (`src/utils/businessHours.ts`):
- `isWithinBusinessHours()` - Check if current time is within business hours
- `isWithinCompanyBusinessHours()` - Check using company settings format
- `getNextBusinessHourSlot()` - Calculate next available business hour slot
- All functions respect timezone settings

## Backend Support

### Business Hours Structure in Database:
```json
{
  "monday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "17:00", "enabled": true},
  "tuesday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "17:00", "enabled": true},
  "wednesday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "17:00", "enabled": true},
  "thursday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "17:00", "enabled": true},
  "friday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "17:00", "enabled": true},
  "saturday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "15:00", "enabled": false},
  "sunday": {"open": "10:00", "close": "14:00", "enabled": false}
}
```

### Workflow Settings Structure:
```json
{
  "timezone": "customer_local",
  "businessHours": {
    "enabled": true,
    "start": "09:00",
    "end": "17:00",
    "days": ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"]
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

1. **Company Settings Page** - Now properly displays and edits business hours
2. **Workflow Builder** - Uses company timezone for business hours calculation
3. **Automation Execution** - Can use businessHours utilities to respect timing

## Result
- No more undefined errors
- Business hours properly initialized for all users
- Timezone-aware business hours checking
- Backend fully supports business hours scheduling
