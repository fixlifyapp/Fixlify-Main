# Edge Functions Deployment Summary

## Date: December 2024

## Issue Fixed
The email buttons for estimates and invoices were still using the old direct link format (`hub.fixlify.app/estimate/[id]`) instead of the new portal token link format (`hub.fixlify.app/portal/[token]`).

## Actions Taken

### 1. Code Review
- Verified that send-estimate function was already using the portal token format ✓
- Verified that send-estimate-sms function was already using the portal token format ✓
- Verified that send-invoice function was already using the portal token format ✓
- Found that send-invoice-sms was still using localhost:8080 ❌

### 2. Code Fix
- Updated send-invoice-sms function to use `https://hub.fixlify.app/portal/${portalToken}` instead of `localhost:8080`

### 3. Configuration Fix
- Fixed supabase/config.toml by removing invalid keys:
  - Removed `port` from [auth] section
  - Removed `email_double_confirm_changes_enabled` from [auth] section
  - Removed `port` from [storage] section

### 4. Missing Files Added
- Created cors.ts for send-estimate-sms function
- Created cors.ts for send-invoice-sms function

### 5. Deployed Edge Functions
All four edge functions have been successfully deployed to Supabase:
- ✅ send-estimate
- ✅ send-estimate-sms
- ✅ send-invoice
- ✅ send-invoice-sms

## Result
The email and SMS functions now use the correct portal token URL format: `https://hub.fixlify.app/portal/[token]`

This ensures that when customers receive estimates or invoices via email or SMS, they will be directed to the proper client portal with secure token-based access instead of the old direct link format.

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Send a test estimate via email - the button should link to hub.fixlify.app/portal/[token]
2. Send a test estimate via SMS - the link should be hub.fixlify.app/portal/[token]
3. Send a test invoice via email - the button should link to hub.fixlify.app/portal/[token]
4. Send a test invoice via SMS - the link should be hub.fixlify.app/portal/[token]
