Level 2: "think hard - design improved authentication with MFA"
Level 3: "think harder - architect complete identity management system"
Level 4: "ultrathink - design enterprise-grade zero-trust security architecture"
```

### The "Specialist Swarm" Pattern

```bash
# Deploy all specialists for comprehensive analysis

"Deploy specialist swarm analysis on user onboarding flow:
- security-auditor: Identify vulnerabilities

- supabase-architect: Data flow optimization
- performance-optimizer: Speed improvements
- ai-integration-expert: Intelligence opportunities
- automation-engineer: Automation potential
- test-engineer: Test coverage gaps
- code-reviewer: Code quality issues
Synthesize findings into actionable improvement plan"
```

## üî• Power-User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Zero-to-Production Feature

```bash
"Implement complete job scheduling system in production:

Hour 1: Planning
- All agents collaborate on architecture design

Hour 2-3: Parallel Development
- Database schema (supabase-architect)
- UI components (frontend-specialist)
- Business logic (automation-engineer)
- AI features (ai-integration-expert)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always use parallel tasks** when possible - 10x faster
2. **Chain specialists** for complex features
3. **Use ultrathink** for architectural decisions
4. **Regular audits** with all agents monthly
5. **Simulate competitors** - have agents analyze what competitors might build

## üöÄ Remember

You're not managing code - you're conducting a symphony of specialized intelligence. Each agent is a master of their craft. Together, they're unstoppable.

**Your only limit is your imagination.**
