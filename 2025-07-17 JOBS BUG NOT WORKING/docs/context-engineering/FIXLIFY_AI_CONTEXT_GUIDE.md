# ü§ñ Fixlify AI Context Guide

## Optimal Context Usage

### 1. **Initial Context Load**
When starting a new conversation, provide:
```
Project: Fixlify AI Automate
Location: C:\Users\petru\Downloads\TEST FIX SITE\3\Fixlify-Main-main
Tools: Desktop Commander (local files), Supabase MCP (database)
Reference: FIXLIFY_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md for project details
```

### 2. **Task-Specific Context**

#### For Bug Fixes:
```
Issue: [Describe the issue]
Affected Area: [e.g., Client Management, Jobs, Automations]
Error Messages: [Any console errors]
Steps to Reproduce: [How to trigger the bug]
Reference: Check FIXLIFY_COMMON_FIXES.md first
```

#### For New Features:
```
Feature: [Feature name]
Module: [Which module it belongs to]
Database Changes: [Yes/No]
UI Changes: [Yes/No]
Reference: Follow patterns in FIXLIFY_PATTERNS.md
```

#### For Database Work:
```
Operation: [Create/Update/Delete]
Tables Affected: [List tables]
RLS Required: [Yes/No]
Migration Needed: [Yes/No]
Use: Supabase MCP for all database operations
```

### 3. **Context Preservation**

When conversation gets long, summarize progress:
```
Progress Summary:
‚úÖ Completed: [What was done]
üîÑ Current: [What we're doing now]
üìã Next: [What needs to be done]
```

### 4. **Error Prevention Context**

Always include these rules:
- No duplicate files/systems
- Test on all devices (PC, tablet, mobile)
- Update knowledge base after fixes
- Deep analyze if problems repeat
- Ask before removing large systems

### 5. **Performance Context**

For performance-sensitive operations:
```
Performance Requirements:
- File chunks: ‚â§30 lines for writes
- Query timeout: 10 seconds max
- Batch operations: Use when >100 items
- Indexes: Check before adding queries
```

## Context Templates

### Bug Fix Template
```markdown
## Bug Fix: [Issue Name]

**Context**: Working on Fixlify app at [location]
**Issue**: [Describe the problem]
**Impact**: [Who/what is affected]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Investigation**:
1. Check error logs
2. Review recent changes
3. Test in different environments

**Solution**: [Proposed fix]

**Testing**: [How to verify the fix]
```

### Feature Implementation Template
```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

**Context**: Adding to Fixlify [module]
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

**Technical Approach**:
- Frontend: [React components needed]
- Backend: [Database changes]
- API: [New endpoints]

**Dependencies**: [External libraries/services]
```

### Database Migration Template
```sql
-- Migration: [migration_name]
-- Purpose: [What this migration does]
-- Date: [Current date]

-- Add your migration SQL here

-- Rollback (if needed):
-- SQL to undo this migration
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Don't dump entire codebase as context
2. **Be Specific**: Provide relevant files/sections only
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep context documents current
4. **Use References**: Point to existing documentation
5. **Preserve State**: Summarize long conversations

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Validate context
npm run validate-context

# Update knowledge base
npm run update-knowledge

# Generate report
npm run context-report

# Check recent fixes
ls -la FIX_*.md | tail -10

# Find context files
find . -name "*CONTEXT*" -o -name "*KNOWLEDGE*"
```

## Common Context Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå Providing entire file contents when only a function is needed
2. ‚ùå Forgetting to mention which tools are available
3. ‚ùå Not updating context after significant changes
4. ‚ùå Missing error messages or console output
5. ‚ùå Vague problem descriptions without reproduction steps

## Context Optimization Tips

1. **Use Anchors**: Reference specific sections in documentation
2. **Layer Context**: Start general, add specifics as needed
3. **Version Context**: Include framework/library versions
4. **Environment Context**: Specify dev/staging/production
5. **Historical Context**: Reference previous fixes for similar issues
