# Edge Functions Security Cleanup - Summary

## 🎉 Cleanup Completed Successfully!

### ✅ Removed Dangerous Functions:
1. **exec-sql** - Critical security vulnerability (arbitrary SQL execution)
2. **update-profiles-schema** - One-time migration (no longer needed)
3. **telnyx-webhook** - Deprecated (replaced by sms-webhook)

### ✅ Code Updates:
1. **src/utils/init-app.ts** - Removed call to update-profiles-schema
2. **FIXLIFY_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md** - Updated edge functions documentation
3. **deploy_sms_schema.js** - Marked as deprecated with safety warning
4. **check_sms_deployment.js** - Marked as deprecated with safety warning

### ✅ Created Safe Alternatives:
1. **supabase/migrations/20250113_safe_sms_schema.sql** - Safe migration file for SMS schema
   - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor instead of using dangerous exec-sql
   - Includes all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and functions

### 📊 Current Edge Functions Status:

#### Active & Safe Functions:
- `send-sms` - SMS sending
- `sms-webhook` - SMS receiving
- `generate-with-ai` - AI insights
- `send-contact-email` - Contact forms
- `automation-executor` - Automations
- `reports-run` & `reports-templates` - Reporting
- `intelligent-ai-assistant` - AI assistant

#### Voice/AI Functions (Review if needed):
- Various Amazon Connect and voice-related functions
- Keep only if using voice features

### 🔒 Security Improvements:
- Eliminated arbitrary SQL execution vulnerability
- Removed deprecated functions
- Reduced attack surface
- All remaining functions have specific, limited purposes

### 📝 Next Steps:
1. Monitor application for any issues
2. Use SQL migrations instead of edge functions for schema changes
3. Consider removing voice/AI functions if not using those features
4. Regular security audits of remaining edge functions

## Migration Instructions:
To apply the SMS schema safely:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Open `supabase/migrations/20250113_safe_sms_schema.sql`
3. Copy and run the SQL in the editor
4. Verify tables were created successfully
