# Circuit Breaker Error Fix

## Issue
The circuit breaker is opening due to too many failed requests when fetching jobs, preventing the app from working properly.

## Root Causes
1. Multiple components trying to fetch jobs simultaneously
2. Failed requests due to missing `user_id` in queries (now fixed)
3. Circuit breaker threshold too low (was 5, now 10)
4. Recovery timeout too long (was 30s, now 15s)

## Fixes Applied
1. Increased circuit breaker threshold from 5 to 10 failures
2. Reduced recovery timeout from 30s to 15s
3. Added reset method to circuit breaker
4. Created utility to reset circuit breaker from console

## How to Reset Circuit Breaker
If you see "Circuit breaker is OPEN" errors, you can reset it:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `resetCircuitBreaker()`
3. Refresh the page

## Prevention
The circuit breaker is a protection mechanism to prevent overwhelming the server with requests. It opens when:
- More than 10 requests fail in a short period
- Network issues cause repeated failures
- Database queries fail repeatedly

## Long-term Solutions
1. Fix the root cause of failing queries (user_id issue - already fixed)
2. Add better error recovery mechanisms
3. Implement request queuing
4. Add exponential backoff for retries
