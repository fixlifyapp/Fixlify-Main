# ✅ USE THE WORKING WEBHOOK

## IMPORTANT UPDATE:
The `ai-assistant-webhook` requires authentication (JWT) which Telnyx doesn't provide. 

## USE THIS WEBHOOK INSTEAD:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables
```

This webhook:
- ✅ Works without authentication
- ✅ Returns greeting_message 
- ✅ Returns all the same variables
- ✅ Is what Telnyx is currently using

## IN TELNYX:
Keep your current settings:
- Webhook URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables`
- Greeting: `{{greeting_message}}`

## WHAT YOU'LL HEAR:
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"

## TEST IT:
Run `test-webhook-greeting.js` in browser console to verify it's working.

## WHY ai-assistant-webhook DOESN'T WORK:
- Supabase Edge Functions require JWT authentication by default
- Telnyx doesn't send JWT tokens with webhook calls
- The telnyx-dynamic-variables webhook was configured to work without auth

## BOTH WEBHOOKS HAVE THE SAME CODE:
They return identical variables including greeting_message. The only difference is authentication requirements.

## TO CHANGE YOUR GREETING:
Update it in the database:
```sql
UPDATE ai_dispatcher_configs 
SET greeting_message = 'Your new greeting here'
WHERE company_name = 'Nicks appliance repair';
```

## STATUS: ✅ WORKING
Use `telnyx-dynamic-variables` - it's already configured and working!
