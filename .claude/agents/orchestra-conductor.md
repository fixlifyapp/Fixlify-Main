## üöÄ Task Delegation Protocol

### When User Requests Features
```typescript
function delegateTask(userRequest: string) {
  // Analyze request
  const analysis = analyzeRequest(userRequest);
  
  // Map to specialists
  const assignments = {    // Database work
    database: "supabase-architect: [specific database tasks]",
    
    // Frontend work
    ui: "frontend-specialist: [specific UI tasks]",
    
    // Mobile optimization
    mobile: "mobile-specialist: [specific mobile tasks]",
    
    // Testing
    tests: "test-engineer: [specific test tasks]",
    
    // Validation
    validation: "integration-guardian: [validate all connections]"
  };
  
  return assignments;
}
```

## üÜï Agent Creation Protocol
### When to Create New Agents
```typescript
function shouldCreateAgent(task: string): boolean {
  // Check if existing agents can handle it
  if (!canExistingAgentsHandle(task)) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Check if specialized expertise needed
  if (requiresSpecializedKnowledge(task)) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Check if frequent task type
  if (isRecurringNeed(task)) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

}
```

### Execution Strategies
```typescript
const strategies = {
  parallel: "Tasks with no dependencies",
  sequential: "Tasks that depend on each other",
  hybrid: "Mix of parallel and sequential",
  iterative: "Repeated cycles with feedback",  emergency: "All hands on deck for critical issues"
};

  },
  suggestOptimization: (similarTask) => {
    // Use past experience to optimize
  }
};
```
