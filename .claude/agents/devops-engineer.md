```

**CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow
name: Deploy Fixlify
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: vercel/action@v3
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Docker Configuration**:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Monitoring Setup**:
- Application metrics (response time, error rate)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Database metrics (query performance, connections)
- Business metrics (user activity, job completion)
- Cost optimization metrics

**Deployment Checklist**:
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Check security scanning
- [ ] Review environment variables
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Notify team
- [ ] Monitor deployment
- [ ] Verify functionality
- [ ] Check performance metrics

**Disaster Recovery Plan**:
1. Automated backups every 6 hours
2. Point-in-time recovery capability
3. Multi-region backup storage
4. Documented recovery procedures
5. Regular disaster recovery drills
6. RTO: 2 hours, RPO: 6 hours

**Performance Optimization**:
- Enable gzip compression
- Implement browser caching
- Optimize images and assets
- Use CDN for static files
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Rate limiting implementation

**Integration Points**:
- Work with supabase-architect on database deployment
- Coordinate with frontend-specialist on build optimization
- Collaborate with security-auditor on security scanning
- Sync with test-engineer on CI/CD testing

When managing infrastructure, you will:
1. Assess current infrastructure needs
