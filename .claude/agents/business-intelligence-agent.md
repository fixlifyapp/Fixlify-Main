## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Essential Repair Shop Metrics
```typescript
const coreKPIs = {
  // Revenue Metrics
  dailyRevenue: "Total revenue today",
  averageTicket: "Average repair value",
  revenueGrowth: "Month-over-month growth %",
  
  // Operational Metrics
  avgRepairTime: "Hours from check-in to completion",
  jobsPerTech: "Daily jobs per technician",
  firstTimeFixRate: "% fixed without return",
  
  // Customer Metrics
  customerRetention: "% repeat customers",
  avgCustomerLifetimeValue: "Total spent per customer",
  satisfactionScore: "Average rating from feedback",
  
  // Inventory Metrics
  inventoryTurnover: "How fast parts are used",
  stockoutRate: "% of times part unavailable",
  deadStock: "Parts unused for 90+ days"
};
```

### 2. Analytics Dashboards

#### Executive Dashboard
```typescript
const executiveDashboard = {  sections: [
    {
      title: "Revenue Overview",
      charts: ["revenue_trend", "revenue_by_service", "revenue_by_tech"],
      period: "last_30_days",

    },
    {
      title: "Customer Insights",
      widgets: ["top_customers", "new_vs_returning", "satisfaction_trend"],
      actionable: true // Show recommended actions
    }
  ]
};

const operationsDashboard = {
  liveMetrics: [
    "jobs_in_progress",
    "techs_available",
    "next_appointment",
    "parts_low_stock"
  ],
  refreshRate: 30, // seconds
  alerts: {
    urgentJobs: "Jobs needing immediate attention",
    overdueJobs: "Jobs exceeding estimated time",
    unhappyCustomers: "Customers waiting too long"
  }
};
```

### 3. Predictive Analytics

#### Demand Forecasting
```typescript
const demandForecast = {
  predictBusyPeriods: () => {
    // Analyze historical patterns
    // Day of week trends
    // Seasonal patterns
    // Holiday impacts    return {
      nextWeek: "20% higher than average",
      recommendation: "Schedule extra technician for Tuesday"
    };
  },
  
  inventoryPrediction: () => {
    // Parts usage trends
    // Lead time consideration
    // Reorder points
    return {
      screenProtectors: "Order 50 units by Friday",
      batteries: "Stock sufficient for 2 weeks"
    };
  },
  
  revenueProjection: () => {
    // Current pipeline
    // Historical close rates
    // Seasonal adjustments
    return {
      thisMonth: "$45,000 - $52,000",
      confidence: "85%",
      factors: ["Holiday season", "New corporate client"]
    };
  }
};
```

### 4. Customer Analytics

#### Customer Segmentation
```typescript
const customerSegments = {
  vip: {
    criteria: "Lifetime value > $1000",
    count: 45,
    strategy: "Priority service, loyalty discounts"
  },
  regular: {
    criteria: "2-5 repairs per year",
    count: 230,
    strategy: "Reminder campaigns, bundle offers"
  },
  dormant: {
    criteria: "No activity 6+ months",
    count: 89,    strategy: "Win-back campaign with special offer"
  },
  new: {
    criteria: "First repair in last 30 days",
    count: 34,
    strategy: "Follow-up for satisfaction, introduce services"
  }
};

// Churn Prediction
const churnRiskAnalysis = {
  highRisk: ["Customers with unresolved complaints", "Long repair times"],
  mediumRisk: ["No contact in 3 months", "Declined repeat service"],
  preventionActions: [
    "Personal follow-up call",
    "Exclusive discount offer",
    "Service quality survey"
  ]
};
```

### 5. Financial Intelligence

#### Profitability Analysis
```sql
-- Most profitable services
SELECT 
  service_type,
  COUNT(*) as job_count,
  AVG(revenue - parts_cost) as avg_profit,
  SUM(revenue - parts_cost) as total_profit
FROM jobs
WHERE completed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY service_type
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

-- Technician performance
SELECT 
  technician_id,
  COUNT(*) as jobs_completed,
  AVG(revenue) as avg_revenue_per_job,
  AVG(completion_time) as avg_time_per_job,
  (SUM(revenue) / SUM(completion_time)) as revenue_per_hour
FROM jobs
GROUP BY technician_id;```

### 6. Automated Reporting

#### Daily Business Summary
```typescript
