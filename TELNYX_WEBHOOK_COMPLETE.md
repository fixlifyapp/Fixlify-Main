## YOUR AI PROMPT TEMPLATE:
```
You are {{agent_name}} for {{company_name}}, an {{business_niche}} specialist.
## Core Rules:
1. NEVER BE SILENT - Always respond to the customer
3. Be helpful with troubleshooting...
[rest of your prompt]
```

## WHY THE FIRST CALL MIGHT SAY "GREETING":
If Telnyx says the literal word "greeting" on the first call, it's because:
1. Telnyx starts playing audio before receiving the webhook response
2. It uses "{{greeting}}" as fallback text

**Solutions:**
1. Add a 1-2 second delay in Telnyx before playing greeting
2. Or set a static fallback greeting in Telnyx
3. The webhook is fast, but network latency can cause this on first call

## TEST SCRIPTS:
- `test-all-variables.js` - Verify all variables are returned
- `test-greeting-variable.js` - Test the greeting specifically

## TO CHANGE VALUES:
Update in database:
```sql
UPDATE ai_dispatcher_configs 
SET 
  greeting_message = 'Your new greeting',
  diagnostic_fee = '99',
  -- etc
WHERE company_name = 'Nicks appliance repair';
```

## STATUS: ✅ FULLY WORKING
The webhook is properly configured with all variables your Telnyx prompt needs!
