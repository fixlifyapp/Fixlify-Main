# Fixing Suspense Boundary Errors

## Issue
The application was throwing an error:
```
Error: A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. 
This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. 
To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition.
```

## Root Cause
When we implemented lazy loading in Phase 2, we didn't properly add Suspense boundaries around all lazy-loaded components. This caused React to suspend without a proper fallback UI.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed LazyRoute Component Definition**
   - The LazyRoute helper component was malformed
   - Fixed the component definition to properly wrap children in Suspense

2. **Added Top-Level Suspense Boundary**
   - Wrapped the entire Routes component in a Suspense boundary
   - This catches any suspension that happens at the route level

3. **Fixed Lazy Import Issues**
   - ConnectCenterPageOptimized was not properly imported as lazy
   - Fixed the import statement and component usage

4. **Added Missing LazyRoute Wrappers**
   - TestPage was missing the LazyRoute wrapper
   - Added LazyRoute wrapper to ensure proper suspension handling

## Code Changes

### Before:
```tsx
// Broken LazyRoute definition
const LazyRoute = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <Suspense fallback={<PageLoader />}>
    {children}
  </Suspense>
);

// Missing Suspense at top level
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    ...
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>

// Component not wrapped
<TestPage />
```

### After:
```tsx
// Fixed LazyRoute definition  
const LazyRoute = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <Suspense fallback={<PageLoader />}>
    {children}
  </Suspense>
);

// Added top-level Suspense
<BrowserRouter>
  <Suspense fallback={<PageLoader />}>
    <Routes>
      ...
    </Routes>
  </Suspense>
</BrowserRouter>

// Properly wrapped component
<LazyRoute>
  <TestPage />
</LazyRoute>
```

## Additional Considerations

For complete fix, we should also:
1. Use React.startTransition for navigation to lazy routes
2. Add error boundaries to catch loading errors
3. Consider preloading critical routes

## Testing
- Navigate to /clients - should load without error
- Navigate to /communications - should load without error
- All lazy-loaded pages should show loading spinner briefly
