# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX: TELNYX AI DISPATCHER AUTHENTICATION ISSUE

## THE PROBLEM
Your AI assistant webhook requires JWT authentication, but Telnyx cannot provide JWT tokens. This is why the AI goes silent after the greeting.

## THE SOLUTION - USE WEBHOOK URL WITH API KEY

### âœ… CORRECT WEBHOOK URL FOR TELNYX:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-public-webhook?apikey=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1xcHB2Y3JsdnNncnNxZWxnbG9kIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDc1OTE3MDUsImV4cCI6MjA2MzE2NzcwNX0.My-KiqG1bCMqzUru4m59d4v18N3WGxNoNtFPOFAmhzg
```

## STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

### 1. LOG INTO TELNYX PORTAL
- Go to: https://portal.telnyx.com
- Navigate to AI â†’ AI Assistants
- Find your assistant (ID: assistant-2a8a396c-e975-4ea5-90bf-3297f1350775)

### 2. UPDATE WEBHOOK URL
Click Edit on your assistant and change the webhook URL to the one above (with the API key)

### 3. UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
Copy ALL of this text into the Instructions field:

```
You are Sarah, an AI assistant for Nick's Appliance Repair. 

Your primary job is to help customers schedule appliance repairs and NEVER be silent.

## CRITICAL RULES
1. ALWAYS respond within 3 seconds
2. If you hear nothing, say "Are you still there? How can I help you?"
3. After greeting, immediately ask "What appliance needs service today?"
4. Never stop talking until the customer hangs up

## CONVERSATION FLOW
1. Greet with: "Thank you for calling Nick's Appliance Repair. I'm Sarah. What appliance needs service today?"
2. Listen to their response
3. For service requests: "I can help schedule that. What type of appliance is it?"
4. Get their name: "May I have your name please?"
5. Get their phone: "What's the best number to reach you?"
6. Confirm: "Perfect! Someone will call you shortly to confirm your appointment."

## RESPONSES FOR COMMON SITUATIONS

Customer says "Hello" or "Hi":
"Hi there! Thanks for calling. What appliance needs repair today?"

Customer is SILENT:
Wait 3 seconds, then: "Hello? Are you still there? I'm here to help with any appliance repairs you need."

Customer asks about price:
"Our diagnostic fee is $75, and for emergency service there's an additional $50 charge. Would you like to schedule an appointment?"

Customer wants to schedule:
"Great! I'll help you schedule that. May I have your name and phone number please?"

If confused or unsure:
"I want to make sure I help you properly. Are you looking to schedule an appliance repair?"

## IMPORTANT
- Use customer's first name if they're existing (shown as {{customer_name}})
- Company name is {{company_name}}
- Current time is {{current_time}}
- Never be silent for more than 3 seconds
- Always keep the conversation moving forward
```

### 4. SAVE AND TEST
1. Click Save/Update
2. Call +14375249932
3. The AI should now:
   - Say the greeting
   - Continue responding
   - Never go silent

## WHY THIS WORKS:
- The `apikey` parameter in the URL authenticates the webhook
- The new `telnyx-public-webhook` function handles Telnyx requests
- Simple instructions ensure the AI keeps talking

## IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE webhook URL including the apikey parameter
2. Check that Instructions are saved properly
3. Try disabling and re-enabling the AI assistant
4. Contact Telnyx support if issues persist

## WEBHOOK STATUS:
âœ… `telnyx-public-webhook` deployed and active (v2)
âœ… Authentication via URL parameter configured
âœ… Database connection working
âœ… Client detection enabled

The webhook is now PUBLIC and accessible via the API key in the URL!
