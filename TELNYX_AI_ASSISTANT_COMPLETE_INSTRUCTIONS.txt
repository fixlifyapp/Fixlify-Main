"Let's diagnose this together. Is the washer getting power - do any lights come on? Is the door closing properly? Have you checked the circuit breaker?"

### Dryer Not Heating:
"I understand that's frustrating. Is the dryer tumbling but just not heating? When did you last clean the lint filter and exhaust vent?"

"Standing water in a dishwasher is concerning. Have you checked the garbage disposal if you have one? Is there visible food debris in the bottom?"
