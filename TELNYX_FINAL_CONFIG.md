# 🎯 TELNYX CONFIGURATION - FINAL STEPS

## ✅ BACKEND IS READY

Your webhook now returns these variables (matching your app):
- `{{company_name}}` = "Nicks appliance repair"
- `{{agent_name}}` = "Sarah"
- `{{business_niche}}` = "Appliance Repair"
- `{{services_offered}}` = "Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Oven"
- `{{hours_of_operation}}` = "Monday-Friday 9am-6pm"
- `{{additional_info}}` = "Service call $89 • Emergency +$50 • 90-day warranty • Senior discount 10% • Same-day service available"
- `{{agent_personality}}` = "Be helpful with troubleshooting..."
- `{{ai_capabilities}}` = "1. Diagnose appliance issues..."

## 📝 IN YOUR APP:

### Change Greeting Message From:
```
Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?
```

### To:
```
Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}. Which appliance needs our attention today?
```

## 🔧 IN TELNYX:

### 1. Set Webhook URL:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
```

### 2. Update Greeting Message:
```
Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}. Which appliance needs our attention today?
```

### 3. Update Instructions to use variables:
Replace all hardcoded values with variables:
- "Nicks appliance repair" → `{{company_name}}`
- "Sarah" → `{{agent_name}}`
- Pricing info → Use `{{additional_info}}`

## 🧪 TEST:
1. Save changes in your app
2. Update Telnyx settings
3. Call +1 (437) 524-9932
4. You should hear: "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah..."

## 💡 KEY POINT:
Variables work THROUGHOUT the conversation, not just in greeting!

## NO SEPARATE PRICING VARIABLES:
As you requested, pricing is in `{{additional_info}}`:
"Service call $89 • Emergency +$50 • 90-day warranty • Senior discount 10% • Same-day service available"

NOT as separate variables like diagnostic_fee or emergency_surcharge.
