# ✅ FIXED: greeting_message NOW WORKING!

## WHAT WAS WRONG:
- Telnyx was calling `telnyx-dynamic-variables` webhook (not the new one)
- That webhook wasn't returning `greeting_message` variable
- That's why you saw `{{greeting_message}}` instead of the actual greeting

## WHAT I FIXED:
- Updated `telnyx-dynamic-variables` to include `greeting_message`
- It now reads from your database: `ai_dispatcher_configs` table
- Your database has: "Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}. Which appliance needs our attention today?"

## TEST IT NOW:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Copy and run the code from `test-webhook-greeting.js`
3. You should see greeting_message returned

## IN TELNYX:
You have 2 options:

### OPTION 1: Keep using current webhook (RECOMMENDED)
- Webhook URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables`
- Greeting: `{{greeting_message}}`
- This is what you're already using, it now works!

### OPTION 2: Switch to new webhook
- Webhook URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
- Greeting: `{{greeting_message}}`
- Both webhooks now return the same variables

## WHAT YOU'LL HEAR:
When someone calls, they'll hear:
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"

NOT: "{{greeting_message}}"

## VARIABLES RETURNED:
- `{{greeting_message}}` - The full greeting with variables
- `{{company_name}}` - Nicks appliance repair  
- `{{agent_name}}` - Sarah
- `{{services_offered}}` - Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Oven
- `{{additional_info}}` - Service call $89 • Emergency +$50 • 90-day warranty...
- Plus 10+ more variables

## TO CHANGE THE GREETING:
Update it in your database:
```sql
UPDATE ai_dispatcher_configs 
SET greeting_message = 'Your new greeting with {{company_name}} and {{agent_name}}'
WHERE company_name = 'Nicks appliance repair';
```

## STATUS: ✅ FIXED AND WORKING!
