# ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: JWT Authentication Blocking Telnyx

## THE PROBLEM:
The webhook has JWT verification enabled (`verify_jwt: true`), which means:
- Telnyx gets a 401 Unauthorized error when calling the webhook
- The greeting variable is never returned
- Telnyx falls back to saying "greeting" literally

## WHY THIS HAPPENS:
Edge Functions require JWT authentication by default, but Telnyx doesn't have your JWT tokens.

## THE SOLUTION:
You need to disable JWT verification for the Telnyx webhook. There are two ways:

### Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Edge Functions
3. Find `telnyx-dynamic-variables`
4. Edit the function settings
5. Disable "Require JWT Verification"

### Option 2: Create a config.toml file locally
Create `supabase/config.toml` in your project:
```toml
[functions.telnyx-dynamic-variables]
verify_jwt = false
```
Then redeploy the function.

### Option 3: Quick Fix - Use a Different Webhook
Since we can't disable JWT via the API, you could:
1. Create a new webhook endpoint that doesn't require auth
2. Use a simple HTTP server or a different service
3. Point Telnyx to that endpoint instead

## IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND:
For now, you can test with a static greeting in Telnyx:
Instead of: `{{greeting}}`
Use: `Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?`

## STATUS: ⚠️ WEBHOOK BLOCKED BY AUTH
The webhook code is correct, but JWT verification is preventing Telnyx from accessing it.
