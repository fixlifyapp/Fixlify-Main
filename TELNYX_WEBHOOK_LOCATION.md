# 🔍 WHERE TO SET THE WEBHOOK IN TELNYX

## ❌ NOT HERE (Webhook Tools):
The "Add Webhook Tool" section you're showing is for tools the AI can use during conversation (like booking appointments, checking availability, etc.)

## ✅ SET IT HERE:
Look for one of these fields in the MAIN assistant configuration:
- **Dynamic Variables Webhook URL**
- **Variables Webhook**
- **Webhook URL** (in the main settings, not in tools)
- **Dynamic Variables** section

## 📍 It should be in the same area as:
- Assistant Name
- Instructions
- Greeting
- Voice Settings
- **Dynamic Variables Webhook URL** ← Look for this!

## 🎯 The Correct URL:
```
https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook
```

## 📊 To Test if it's Working:

Run this in your browser console:
```javascript
fetch('https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    data: {
      payload: {
        telnyx_conversation_channel: "phone_call",
        telnyx_agent_target: "+14375249932",
        telnyx_end_user_target: "+14375621308"
      }
    }
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

You should see your company data returned!

## 🚨 Important:
The webhook we built provides VARIABLES (company_name, agent_name, etc.) when the call starts.
It's NOT a tool for the AI to use during conversation.

## If You Want to Add Tools (Optional):
If you want the AI to be able to:
- Book appointments
- Check availability
- Update customer records

Then you would need a DIFFERENT webhook for that (like the MCP server we discussed earlier).
