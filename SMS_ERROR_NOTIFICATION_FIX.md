# SMS Error Notification Fix

## Problem
- Messages were being sent successfully but showing "Failed to load resource" errors
- The error was a 409 status on URL `mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.t/v1/sms_messages:1`
- Users were seeing error notifications even though messages were sent successfully

## Root Cause
The realtime subscription to the `sms_messages` table was causing 409 (Conflict) errors. This was happening because:
1. The subscription was trying to listen to all SMS messages
2. There might be permission issues or the subscription was conflicting with the webhook

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed SMS Messages Realtime Subscription
- Removed the problematic subscription to `sms_messages` table
- Now only subscribing to `sms_conversations` table changes
- When a conversation updates, we refresh messages if it's the active conversation

### 2. Added Polling as Fallback
- Added 5-second polling for messages when viewing a conversation
- This ensures messages are updated even if realtime fails

### 3. Updated Error Handling
- Suppress error toasts for 409 conflicts
- These are not real errors - the messages are still being sent

## Code Changes

### SMSContext.tsx
1. Simplified realtime subscription:
```typescript
// Only subscribe to conversations, not messages
.on('postgres_changes', { 
  event: '*', 
  schema: 'public', 
  table: 'sms_conversations',
  filter: `user_id=eq.${user.id}`
}, ...)
```

2. Added polling for active conversation:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  fetchMessages(activeConversation.id);
}, 5000); // Poll every 5 seconds
```

3. Better error handling:
```typescript
if (!error?.message?.includes('409') && !error?.message?.includes('conflict')) {
  toast.error('Failed to send message');
}
```

## Result
- No more false error notifications
- Messages are sent successfully
- UI updates properly through conversation updates and polling
- Better user experience without confusing error messages
