# Two-Way Calling Implementation Guide

## Overview
The unified two-way calling system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Unified Call Manager** (`src/components/calling/UnifiedCallManager.tsx`)
   - Single interface for all calling operations
   - Supports both inbound and outbound calls
   - Real-time call duration tracking
   - Client identification from phone numbers
   - AI vs regular call support
   - Mute/unmute functionality
   - Incoming call popup with accept/decline options

2. **Reusable Call Button** (`src/components/calling/CallButton.tsx`)
   - Can be placed anywhere in the app
   - Opens UnifiedCallManager in a dialog
   - Supports pre-filled phone numbers and client IDs

3. **Call History** (`src/components/calling/CallHistory.tsx`)
   - View all past calls
   - Quick callback functionality
   - Filter by call type and status

4. **Configuration Management** (`src/config/telnyx.ts`)
   - Centralized Telnyx configuration
   - Environment variable support
   - Your actual values are already configured:
     - Connection ID: `2709042883142354871`
     - Phone Number: `+14375249932`
     - Webhook URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-voice-webhook`

5. **Database Schema**
   - Updated `telnyx_calls` table with all required columns
   - Added `connection_id` to `telnyx_phone_numbers` table
   - Proper tracking of call metadata

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8082/**

### 2. Navigate to Communications Settings
1. Click on "Settings" in the sidebar
2. Go to "Communications Settings" tab
3. You'll see the Telnyx configuration section

### 3. Make an Outbound Call
1. From any client page, click the phone icon
2. Or go to Connect Center and click "New Call"
3. Select your phone number (or it will use the default)
4. Enter the destination number
5. Click "Call" to initiate

### 4. Receive Inbound Calls
1. When someone calls your Telnyx number
2. A popup will appear showing the caller info
3. Click "Accept" to answer or "Decline" to reject
4. If the caller is a known client, their name will be shown

### 5. Enable AI Dispatcher
1. In the call interface, toggle "AI Dispatcher"
2. When enabled, incoming calls will be handled by AI
3. The AI can schedule appointments, answer questions, etc.

## Important Setup Steps

### 1. Set Telnyx API Key in Supabase
```bash
# You need to set this in your Supabase Edge Functions secrets
TELNYX_API_KEY=your_actual_telnyx_api_key
```

### 2. Create Local Environment File (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
VITE_TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID=2709042883142354871
VITE_TELNYX_DEFAULT_FROM_NUMBER=+14375249932
```

### 3. Verify Webhook Configuration
Your Telnyx webhook is already configured to:
`https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-voice-webhook`

## Testing the System

### Test Outbound Calls
1. Go to any client profile
2. Click the phone icon next to their number
3. The call dialog will open with the number pre-filled
4. Click "Call" to initiate

### Test Inbound Calls
1. Call your Telnyx number: `+1-437-524-9932`
2. You should see an incoming call popup in the app
3. Accept or decline the call

### Test AI Dispatcher
1. Enable AI Dispatcher in the call interface
2. Have someone call your number
3. The AI will answer and handle the call automatically

## Troubleshooting

### If calls aren't working:
1. Check that your Telnyx API key is set in Supabase
2. Verify the webhook URL is correctly configured in Telnyx
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Look at the Supabase Edge Function logs

### If incoming calls don't show popups:
1. Ensure you're logged into the app
2. Check that real-time subscriptions are working
3. Verify the webhook is receiving events from Telnyx
