# Backup Organization Summary - July 16, 2025

## Actions Taken

1. **Consolidated all backup folders** into the main `backups` directory:
   - Moved `backup_2025_07_08` folder
   - Moved `backup_2025_07_12` folder
   - Moved `backup_automation_fix_2024` folder
   - Moved `backup_before_sms_email_2025_07_10` folder
   - Moved `supabase-backup` folder
   - Moved `src_backup_20250711-190145` folder
   - Moved `src_backup_before_restore_20250711-183654` folder

2. **Organized backup scripts** into `backups/scripts/`:
   - `backup-supabase.ps1` - Windows PowerShell script for Supabase backup
   - `backup-supabase.sh` - Linux/Mac shell script for Supabase backup
   - `create_backup.bat` - Windows batch file for creating backups
   - `create_backup.ps1` - PowerShell script for creating backups
   - `create_backup_zip.ps1` - PowerShell script for creating zip backups
   - `export-supabase-data.cjs` - Node.js script for exporting Supabase data

3. **Created documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Comprehensive guide explaining the backup structure
   - Moved existing `BACKUP_README.md` into the backups folder

## Current Structure

└── BACKUP_README.md              # Original backup documentation
```

## Benefits

- All backups are now in one central location
- Easy to find and manage backups
- Scripts are organized separately
- Clear naming conventions and documentation
- No duplicate backup folders scattered around the project

## Next Steps

- Use the scripts in `backups/scripts/` to create new backups
- Follow the guidelines in `README.md` for backup best practices
- Test restore procedures periodically
