# Automation Hooks Implementation Summary

## Step 10 Completed: Automation Hooks

### 1. Created Enhanced Automation Hooks

All hooks are located in `/src/hooks/automations/`:

#### **useAutomations.ts** (Enhanced existing)
- Main hook for managing automation workflows
- Handles CRUD operations for workflows
- Real-time subscriptions for updates
- Integration with organization context

#### **useAutomationBuilder.ts** (New)
- Visual workflow builder state management
- Node and edge manipulation
- Workflow validation
- Test execution with sample data
- Convert visual flow to database format

#### **useAutomationTemplates.ts** (New)
- Template gallery management
- Category filtering and search
- Recommended templates based on organization type
- Template usage tracking
- Preview data generation

#### **useAutomationExecution.ts** (New)
- Execute workflows in real-time or test mode
- Process triggers and actions sequentially
- Integration with Telnyx and Mailgun services
- Variable interpolation
- Execution history tracking

#### **useAutomationAnalytics.ts** (New)
- Comprehensive automation metrics
- Workflow performance tracking
- Time series data for charts
- Revenue impact calculation
- AI-powered insights and recommendations

### 2. Database Schema Updates

Created migration file: `/supabase/migrations/20240124_enhanced_automations.sql`

New tables:
- `automation_templates` - Pre-built automation templates
- `automation_workflows` - User-created automations
- `automation_history` - Execution history and logs
- `communication_templates` - Email/SMS templates
- `automation_template_usage` - Template analytics

Enhanced tables:
- `communication_logs` - Added automation tracking
- `jobs` - Added automation creation tracking
- `tasks` - Added automation creation tracking

### 3. Service Integration

Existing services in `/src/services/communications/`:
- **TelnyxService.ts** - SMS and voice capabilities
- **MailgunService.ts** - Email sending and tracking

These are already integrated into the automation execution hook.

### 4. Edge Functions

- Existing: `/supabase/functions/automation-executor/`
- Created alias: `/supabase/functions/execute-automation/` (for consistency with hooks)

### 5. Key Features Implemented

1. **Visual Workflow Builder Support**
   - Node-based workflow creation
   - Drag-and-drop interface ready
   - Real-time validation

2. **Template System**
   - Pre-built templates for common scenarios
   - Industry-specific recommendations
   - Usage analytics

3. **Execution Engine**
   - Trigger evaluation
   - Sequential action processing
   - Variable interpolation
   - Test mode with previews

4. **Analytics & Insights**
   - Performance metrics
   - Time saved calculations
   - Revenue impact tracking
   - AI-powered recommendations

### 6. Unified Automation System

- Deprecated the old `/src/hooks/useAutomations.ts` (now redirects to new location)
- All automation hooks are now in `/src/hooks/automations/`
- Single source of truth for automation functionality
- No duplicate systems

## What You Need From Me:

### 1. **Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env` file if not already present:

```env
# Telnyx Configuration
VITE_TELNYX_API_KEY=your_telnyx_api_key_here
VITE_TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID=2709042883142354871
VITE_TELNYX_DEFAULT_FROM_NUMBER=+14375249932
VITE_TELNYX_MESSAGING_PROFILE_ID=your_messaging_profile_id_here

# Mailgun Configuration
VITE_MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key_here
VITE_MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.yourdomain.com
VITE_MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@yourdomain.com
VITE_MAILGUN_FROM_NAME=Fixlify
VITE_MAILGUN_EU=false

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_AUTOMATION_BUILDER=true
VITE_ENABLE_AI_ASSISTANT=true
VITE_ENABLE_TEMPLATE_GALLERY=true
```

### 2. **Supabase Configuration**

Run the migration to create the new tables:
```bash
npx supabase migration up
```

Also add these environment variables in your Supabase dashboard (Project Settings > Edge Functions):
```
TELNYX_API_KEY=your_telnyx_api_key_here
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key_here
```

### 3. **API Keys Status**

Please confirm:
- Do you have your Telnyx API key and connection configured?
- Do you have your Mailgun API key and domain configured?
- Are both services active and funded?

### 4. **Next Steps**

After you provide the environment variables, we should:
1. Test the automation execution with your actual API keys
2. Create the visual workflow builder component (Phase 2)
3. Implement the template gallery UI
4. Add the automation analytics dashboard

## Notes on Existing Implementation

Your project already has:
- ✅ Telnyx and Mailgun services implemented
- ✅ Basic automation system in place
- ✅ Communication logging infrastructure
- ✅ Edge functions for webhooks
- ✅ Multi-tenancy support

The new hooks enhance and unify the existing system without creating duplicates. They provide:
- Better state management for complex workflows
- Template-based automation creation
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Visual builder support

The implementation follows your plan exactly and integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase.
