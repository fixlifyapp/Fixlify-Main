# Two-Way SMS Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

We've successfully implemented a complete two-way SMS system for Fixlify using Telnyx and Supabase Edge Functions.

### Key Components

1. **Outbound SMS (Already Working)**
   - Edge Function: `send-sms`
   - Handles phone number formatting to E.164
   - Stores messages in database
   - Updates conversation tracking
   - Used in Connect Center SMS tab

2. **Inbound SMS (Just Implemented)**
   - Edge Function: `sms-webhook`
   - Receives incoming messages from Telnyx
   - Auto-creates client records for unknown numbers
   - Creates/updates conversations
   - Tracks unread message counts
   - Handles delivery status updates

### Security Features

1. **Production-Ready Webhook Security**
   - JWT verification disabled (standard for webhooks)
   - HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
   - Validates Telnyx request authenticity
   - Prevents webhook replay attacks
   - HTTPS only (enforced by Supabase)

2. **Database Security**
   - Service role key used for admin operations
   - Proper foreign key relationships
   - RLS policies on all tables

### Auto-Client Creation

When an unknown number sends an SMS:
- New client record created automatically
- Named as "Unknown (phone number)"
- Set as type: individual, status: lead
- Notes field documents auto-creation time
- Links to conversation for tracking

### Message Deduplication

- Uses Telnyx message ID to prevent duplicates
- Checks database before inserting new messages
- Handles webhook retries gracefully

### Asynchronous Processing

- Webhook acknowledges receipt immediately (200 OK)
- Processes message in background
- Prevents Telnyx timeout/retry issues
- Logs all operations for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Webhook**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy sms-webhook --no-verify-jwt
   ```

2. **Set Webhook Secret**
   ```bash
   # Generate secure secret
   openssl rand -hex 32
   
   # Set in Supabase
   npx supabase secrets set TELNYX_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here
   ```

3. **Configure Telnyx**
   - Add webhook URL: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/sms-webhook`
   - Set the same secret in Telnyx
   - Enable "Inbound Message" events

4. **Test the System**
   - Send SMS to your Telnyx number
   - Check logs in Supabase dashboard
   - Verify messages appear in Connect Center
   - Test with unknown numbers for auto-client creation

## Monitoring

- Function Logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod/functions/sms-webhook/logs
- Database Tables: sms_messages, sms_conversations, clients
- Check for webhook errors or failed deliveries
