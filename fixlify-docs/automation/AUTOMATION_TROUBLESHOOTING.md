# Automation System - Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status

### Edge Functions Deployed:
- **automation-executor** ‚úÖ (v349)
- **mailgun-email** ‚úÖ (v97) 
- **telnyx-sms** ‚úÖ (v94)

### Database Fixed:
- Removed foreign key constraint on `organization_id`
- Added performance indexes
- Created organizations table

## üîß If Test Still Fails

### 1. Check API Keys in Supabase
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod/functions/secrets

Ensure these are set:
- `MAILGUN_API_KEY`
- `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` (should be `fixlify.app`)
- `TELNYX_API_KEY`
- `TELNYX_MESSAGING_PROFILE_ID`

### 2. Verify User Profile
The test needs a user profile with organization_id. Check browser console for errors.

### 3. Test Edge Functions Individually
Click "Test Edge Functions" button first to verify each function is accessible.

### 4. Check Browser Console
Press F12 and look for detailed error messages when running tests.

## üöÄ Expected Test Flow

1. **Setup**: Gets user profile and organization_id
2. **Create Workflow**: Creates a test automation workflow
3. **Trigger Workflow**: Executes the workflow via edge function
4. **Execute Steps**: Runs email and SMS actions (in test mode)
5. **Check Logs**: Verifies execution was logged
6. **Cleanup**: Removes test workflow

## üìù Common Issues

### "Failed to create test workflow"
- Check browser console for specific error
- Usually means missing user profile or organization_id

### "Edge functions not accessible"
- Functions are deployed but may need a moment to warm up
- Try "Test Edge Functions" first

### "No phone number configured"
- SMS function requires a phone number in the phone_numbers table
- Add one in Settings ‚Üí Phone Numbers

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Run "Test Edge Functions" to verify connectivity
2. Run "Run Full Test" for complete automation test
3. Check execution logs in the Monitor tab
4. Review analytics in the Analytics tab

The automation system is fully deployed and ready to use!
