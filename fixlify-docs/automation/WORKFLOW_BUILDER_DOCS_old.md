## Example Workflows

### 1. Smart Review Request Workflow
**Trigger**: Job Completed (for jobs > $500)
**Steps**:
1. Wait 1 day
2. Send personalized SMS asking for review
3. If no response, wait 3 days
4. Send follow-up email with review link

### 2. VIP Customer Thank You
**Trigger**: Invoice Paid (amount > $1000)
**Steps**:
1. Send $50 gift card immediately
2. Send thank you email
3. Wait 30 days
4. Send maintenance reminder

### 3. Weather-Based HVAC Campaign
**Trigger**: Weather Forecast (temperature > 90Â°F in next 3 days)
**Steps**:
1. Send SMS to customers without recent AC service
2. Include special discount code
3. Wait 1 day
4. Send follow-up email to non-responders

## Best Practices

1. **Test Before Activating**: Use the test mode to simulate workflow execution
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with single-step workflows and add complexity gradually
3. **Use Variables**: Personalize messages with customer and job details
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check execution and success rates regularly
5. **Respect Timing**: Enable business hours and quiet hours for better customer experience

## Technical Implementation

The workflow system uses:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB columns for flexible configuration
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase subscriptions for live status updates
- **Queue System**: Background job processing for reliable execution
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff

## Migration from Old System

Existing automations are automatically converted to the new workflow format:
- Simple automations become single-step workflows
- Trigger conditions are preserved and enhanced
- Message templates are migrated with variables intact
