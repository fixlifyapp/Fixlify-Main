# Debug Steps for SMS Issue

## What I've Done:
1. ✅ Confirmed webhook URL is configured in Telnyx
2. ✅ Deployed enhanced debug webhook that logs everything
3. ✅ Added detailed logging to track message processing

## Next Steps:
1. **Ask Petrus to send a new SMS now**
2. Wait 10-20 seconds
3. I'll check the logs to see:
   - If Telnyx is sending the webhook
   - What data format they're using
   - Where the processing might be failing

## What the Debug Webhook Does:
- Logs ALL incoming requests
- Stores webhook data in sms_webhook_logs table
- Shows detailed processing steps
- Helps identify exactly where the issue is

Please have Petrus send a message now, and I'll investigate!
