# Email Setup Configuration Summary

## Current Status ✅
1. **SMS Infrastructure**: ✅ Already working with Telnyx API
   - `send-sms` edge function is active
   - SMS sending for estimates works correctly
   - User has primary phone number configured (+14375249932)

2. **Email Edge Functions**: ✅ Deployed to Supabase
   - `mailgun-email`: Core email sending function using Mailgun API
   - `send-estimate`: Sends estimate emails with portal links
   - `send-invoice`: Sends invoice emails with payment links

## Required Configuration ⚠️

### Mailgun API Setup
You need to add the following secrets to Supabase Edge Functions:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod/functions/secrets
2. Click "New secret" and add these:

   - **MAILGUN_API_KEY**: Your Mailgun API key (format: `key-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - **MAILGUN_DOMAIN**: Your Mailgun domain (e.g., `mg.yourdomain.com` or `sandbox.mailgun.org` for testing)
   - **MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL**: (Optional) Default from email (defaults to `noreply@fixlify.com`)

### Getting Mailgun Credentials
1. Go to https://app.mailgun.com/
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Get your API key from the API Keys section
4. Set up and verify your domain (or use sandbox for testing)

## How It Works

### Email Flow
1. User clicks "Send Email" on an estimate/invoice
2. The frontend calls the respective edge function (`send-estimate` or `send-invoice`)
3. The edge function:
   - Fetches the document details from database
   - Generates a beautiful HTML email template
   - Calls the `mailgun-email` function to send the email
   - Logs the communication in the database
   - Updates the document status

### Features Included
- Beautiful HTML email templates with company branding
- Portal links for online viewing
- Payment links for invoices
- Communication logging for audit trail
- Support for custom messages
- Automatic status updates

## Testing
Once you've configured the Mailgun secrets:
1. Go to an estimate or invoice in the app
2. Click the email send button
3. The email should be sent via Mailgun
4. Check the communication logs for confirmation

## Important Notes
- All email functions now use Mailgun (not Resend)
- SMS functions continue to use Telnyx
- Both systems log to `communication_logs` table for tracking
