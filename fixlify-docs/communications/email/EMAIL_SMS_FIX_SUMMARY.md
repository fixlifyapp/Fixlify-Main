# Email & SMS System Fix Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Edge Functions Deployed**
- ✅ `mailgun-email` - Handles email sending via Mailgun API
- ✅ `send-estimate` - Handles estimate email sending with portal links
- ✅ `notifications` - Already existed for SMS via Telnyx

### 2. **Scripts Created**
- `test_email_final.js` - Comprehensive test and fix script
- `fix_email_issues.js` - Step-by-step email fix process
- `test_email_sms_complete.js` - Full communication test suite
- `deploy_edge_functions.bat` - Windows deployment script

### 3. **Data Isolation Verified**
- ✅ RLS policies properly filter by `user_id` or `created_by`
- ✅ Estimates are isolated per user
- ✅ Clients are isolated per user
- ✅ Communication logs track all sends

## 🚀 How to Use

### To Send an Estimate via Email:

1. **Ensure Client Has Email**
   - Go to Clients page
   - Edit client and add email address
   - Or run `fix_email_issues.js` to add demo emails

2. **Send Estimate**
   - Go to Jobs > Select Job > Estimates tab
   - Click "Send" on any estimate
   - Choose "Email" as send method
   - Add optional custom message
   - Click "Send Estimate"

3. **What Happens**
   - Email sent to client with estimate details
   - Portal link included for client to view/approve
   - Communication logged in system
   - Estimate status updated to "sent"

### To Test the System:

Run in browser console:
```javascript
// Load and run the test script
fetch('/test_email_final.js')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(eval);
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Client email not found"
**Solution:** Add email to the client before sending

### Issue: "Failed to send email" 
**Solution:** Check Mailgun configuration:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod/functions/secrets
2. Ensure these secrets exist:
   - `MAILGUN_API_KEY`
   - `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`
   - `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL` (optional)

### Issue: Edge function not found (404)
**Solution:** Deploy edge functions:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\petru\Downloads\TEST FIX SITE\3\Fixlify-Main-main
deploy_edge_functions.bat
```

## 📊 Data Isolation

All data is properly isolated by user:
- Estimates: Filtered by `user_id` or `created_by`
- Clients: Filtered by `user_id` or `created_by`
- Jobs: Filtered by `user_id`
- Communication logs: Filtered by `user_id`

## 🔐 Security

- All edge functions require authentication
- RLS policies enforce data isolation
- Portal access uses secure tokens
- Email content is sanitized

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Configure Mailgun** (if not done):
   - Sign up at mailgun.com
   - Verify your domain
   - Get API credentials
   - Add to Supabase secrets

2. **Configure Telnyx** (for SMS):
   - Get API key from Telnyx
   - Add `TELNYX_API_KEY` to secrets
   - Add `TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER` to secrets

3. **Test with Real Data**:
   - Add real client emails
   - Send test estimates
   - Monitor communication logs

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When everything is working:
- ✅ `test_email_final.js` shows all green checkmarks
- ✅ Estimates send without errors
- ✅ Communication logs show "sent" status
- ✅ Clients receive emails with portal links
- ✅ Portal links work for client access

---

**Note:** This system now properly handles email sending with complete data isolation between users. Each user only sees and can send to their own clients.
