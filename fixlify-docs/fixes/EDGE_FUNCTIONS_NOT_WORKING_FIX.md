# 🚨 EDGE FUNCTIONS NOT WORKING - ISSUE & SOLUTION

## Problem Identified
The edge functions we created (`send-estimate`, `send-invoice`, `send-estimate-sms`, `send-invoice-sms`, `mailgun-email`, `telnyx-sms`) are returning 404 errors. This means they were created in the Supabase system but are NOT actually deployed and running.

## Current Status
- ❌ All edge functions return 404 (Not Found)
- ❌ Email sending not working
- ❌ SMS sending not working
- ✅ Database operations working
- ✅ UI/Dialog working correctly

## Temporary Workaround (ACTIVE NOW)
I've implemented a workaround that:
1. **Saves the communication record** to the database
2. **Updates the document status** to 'sent'
3. **Copies the portal link** to clipboard for manual sharing
4. **Shows success message** with a warning that the service is offline

This allows you to continue working while we fix the edge functions.

## Permanent Solution Options

### Option 1: Deploy Edge Functions via Supabase CLI (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# 1. Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# 2. Login to Supabase
supabase login

# 3. Link your project
cd "C:\Users\petru\Downloads\TEST FIX SITE\3\Fixlify-Main-main"
supabase link --project-ref mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod

# 4. Create the functions locally
mkdir -p supabase/functions/send-estimate
mkdir -p supabase/functions/send-invoice
mkdir -p supabase/functions/send-estimate-sms
mkdir -p supabase/functions/send-invoice-sms
mkdir -p supabase/functions/mailgun-email
mkdir -p supabase/functions/telnyx-sms

# 5. Deploy each function
supabase functions deploy send-estimate
supabase functions deploy send-invoice
supabase functions deploy send-estimate-sms
supabase functions deploy send-invoice-sms
supabase functions deploy mailgun-email
supabase functions deploy telnyx-sms
```

### Option 2: Use Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod/functions
2. Check if the functions are listed but not deployed
3. Click on each function and deploy it manually

### Option 3: Use External Services Directly
Instead of edge functions, integrate directly with:
- **EmailJS** for emails (works from frontend)
- **Twilio Verify** for SMS (has frontend SDK)

## What Went Wrong?
The Supabase MCP (Machine Control Protocol) we used can create edge function definitions but cannot actually deploy them to run. The functions exist in the database but are not running as HTTP endpoints.

## Checking Deployment Status
Run this in your browser console:
```javascript
// This will show which functions are actually deployed
fetch('https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Deployed functions:', data))
  .catch(err => console.log('No functions endpoint available'));
```

## Next Steps
1. **For now**: Use the workaround (already active)
2. **Soon**: Deploy the edge functions properly using Supabase CLI
3. **Alternative**: Set up a backend service to process the queued communications

## Portal Links Still Work!
Even though emails/SMS aren't sending, the portal links still work:
- Estimates: `https://your-domain.com/estimate/{estimate-id}`
- Invoices: `https://your-domain.com/invoice/{invoice-id}`

These are automatically copied to your clipboard when you click send.
