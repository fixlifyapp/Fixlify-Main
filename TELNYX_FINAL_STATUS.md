# 🎯 TELNYX AI DISPATCHER - FINAL SETUP CONFIRMATION

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURED CORRECTLY:

### Phone Number:
- **Number**: +1 (437) 524-9932
- **Name**: Primary Business Line - Petrusenko
- **Status**: ✅ Purchased
- **AI Dispatcher**: ✅ ENABLED

### Company Configuration:
- **Company**: Nicks appliance repair
- **Agent Name**: Sarah
- **Business Type**: Appliance Repair

- **Diagnostic Fee**: $75

### Webhook Status:
- **URL**: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING (Last call: Today 17:35)
- **Response**: ✅ Returning correct company data

## 🔍 THE ONLY ISSUE:

The webhook URL needs to be set in the RIGHT place in Telnyx:

### ❌ WRONG PLACE:
- "Add Webhook Tool" (This is for actions DURING calls, not for variables)

### ✅ RIGHT PLACE:
In your Telnyx AI Assistant settings, look for:
1. **"Dynamic Variables Webhook URL"**
2. **"Variables Webhook"**  
3. **"Webhook Configuration"**
4. **"Dynamic Variables"** section

## 📞 HOW TO TEST:

1. Call +1 (437) 524-9932
2. You should hear: "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah..."
3. If you hear generic greeting, the webhook URL isn't set in Telnyx

## 🎬 WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW:

When someone calls your number:
1. ✅ Telnyx receives the call
2. ✅ Telnyx calls your webhook (confirmed in logs)
3. ✅ Webhook returns "Nicks appliance repair" data
4. ❓ Telnyx might not be using it (if URL not set in right place)

## 🚀 ACTION NEEDED:

In Telnyx portal:
1. Go to your AI Assistant configuration
2. Look for "Dynamic Variables" or "Variables Webhook" field
3. Enter: `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-assistant-webhook`
4. Save and test with a call

## 💡 TIP:
The webhook field is usually in the SAME section as:
- Assistant Name
- Instructions/System Prompt
- Greeting Message
- Voice Selection

NOT in the Tools/Actions section!
