## Recent Fixes & Updates

### July 2025 Updates

- **FIXED: Automation Triggers Not Executing** (July 30, 2025)
  - Issue: Automations were being triggered (logs created) but not executed when creating jobs or changing status
  - Root causes:
    - Automation workflows had no steps defined (steps: [])
    - Database triggers only created logs but didn't call edge functions
    - Missing integration between job operations and automation execution
  - Solution:
    - Created fix functions to add email actions to existing workflows
    - Added process function to execute pending automation logs
    - Created useAutomationTrigger hook for direct edge function calls
    - Added FixAutomationButton component for manual fixes
  - Components created:
    - `/utils/automation-fixes/fix-automation-triggers.ts` - Fix utilities
    - `/components/automations/FixAutomationButton.tsx` - UI for fixes
    - `/hooks/use-automation-job-trigger.ts` - Direct automation triggers
  - Usage:
    - Click "Fix Automation Triggers" to add email actions to workflows
    - Click "Process Pending" to execute any pending automation logs
    - Import useAutomationTrigger in job components to trigger on events
  - Result: Automations now execute properly when jobs are created or status changes

- **IMPLEMENTED: Permanent Automation Processing Solution** (July 30, 2025)
  - Created automatic background processing for automations:
    - `AutomationProcessorService` - Processes pending logs every 30 seconds
    - `AutomationProcessorProvider` - Context provider that starts/stops processor
    - `process-automation-queue` edge function - For CRON-based processing
    - Database migration to fix existing workflows and improve triggers
  - Key features:
    - Automatic processing of pending automation logs
    - Retries for failed automations
    - Default email action added to workflows with no steps
    - Background service runs while user is logged in
    - Edge function for server-side processing
  - Result: Automations now execute automatically without manual intervention
  
- **FINALIZED: Automation System Configuration** (July 30, 2025)
  - **Supported Triggers**:
    - Jobs: job_created, job_status_changed, job_scheduled
    - Clients: client_created, client_updated, client_tags_changed
    - Estimates: estimate_sent, estimate_accepted, estimate_declined
    - Invoices: invoice_sent, invoice_paid, invoice_overdue
    - Payments: payment_received
    - Scheduling: appointment_reminder, follow_up_due
  - **Supported Actions**:
    - Communication: email, sms
    - Workflow: task, wait, conditional
    - AI: ai_generate
    - Data: update_field, tag_client
    - Business: create_invoice, schedule_job
  - **Removed Features** (not implemented):
    - Triggers: sms_received, email_received, review_submitted, job_updated
    - Actions: notification (push), webhook (external API)
  - All configurations stored in `/src/data/automation-config.ts`

- **FIXED: Automation Job Status Dropdown** (July 30, 2025)
  - Issue: Job status dropdowns in automation triggers were showing only "Any Status" instead of actual statuses
  - Root causes:
    - Conflicting RLS policies on job_statuses table preventing data access
    - useConfigItems hook was loading data before user authentication was complete
    - Multiple conflicting RLS policies causing permission issues
  - Solution:
    - Cleaned up and simplified RLS policies for job_statuses table
    - Added user authentication check before fetching data
    - Updated TriggerStatusChangeConfig to fetch statuses directly with proper error handling
    - Added debug logging to track data loading issues
  - Result: Job status dropdowns now properly show all configured statuses (New, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled, On Hold)

- **FIXED: Job Details Status Update** (July 30, 2025)
  - Issue: Job status changes in the job details page were not updating the UI properly
  - Root causes:
    - Multiple layers of status state (job.status, currentStatus) not syncing properly
    - JobInfoSection receiving job.status directly instead of currentStatus from context
    - Missing synchronization between database updates and UI state
  - Solution:
    - Modified JobDetailsHeader to pass currentStatus from context to JobInfoSection
    - Added proper synchronization in useJobData hook to sync currentStatus with job.status
    - Enhanced real-time subscription to update currentStatus immediately on changes
    - Fixed status badge variant mapping for standardized status values
    - Added forced refresh after status update to ensure UI consistency
  - Result: Job status now updates properly in both the UI and database, with real-time sync

- **FIXED: Job Status Update & Real-time Updates** (July 30, 2025)
  - Issue: Job status changes were not persisting properly and the jobs list was not updating in real-time
  - Root causes:
    - Inconsistent status values between jobs table ("scheduled", "completed") and job_statuses table ("New", "Completed")
    - Real-time updates were disabled in useJobsOptimized hook
    - Status comparison using lowercase when database values were capitalized
    - Multiple automation triggers potentially interfering
  - Solution:
    - Created migration to standardize all job statuses to match job_statuses table values
    - Added CHECK constraint to ensure only valid statuses can be inserted
    - Re-enabled real-time subscriptions with proper filtering
    - Updated JobStatusBadge and JobsList to use exact status matching
    - Enhanced logging throughout status update flow
    - Added 500ms debounce for real-time updates to prevent excessive refreshes
  - Result: Job status updates now persist correctly and the jobs list updates in real-time

- **FIXED: Automation Variable Replacement** (July 30, 2025)
  - Issue: Variables in automation messages ({{job.scheduledDate}}, {{company.name}}, etc.) were not being replaced with actual data
  - Root cause:
    - The automation executor's enrichContext function was looking for fields that didn't exist in the database
    - Job table uses `date`, `schedule_start`, `schedule_end` fields, not `scheduled_date`
    - Company information wasn't being fetched due to missing user_id in enriched data
  - Solution:
    - Updated enrichContext function to use actual database field names
    - Added proper date formatting using schedule_start/schedule_end or date field
    - Added user_id to enriched job data to enable company data fetching
    - Fixed field mapping for all job properties (address, technician_id, etc.)
  - Result: All variables now properly replaced - job details, client info, and company data show correctly in emails/SMS

- **FIXED: Automation Business Hours Toggle** (July 29, 2025)
  - Issue: Business hours toggle in automation workflow steps was not saving/syncing properly
  - Root cause: 
    - SmartTimingOptions component was rendered globally instead of per-action step
    - Timing configuration was not being saved with each action step's config
    - Edge function was not checking business hours before executing actions
  - Solution:
    - Moved SmartTimingOptions into each action step configuration
    - Added timing button to show/hide timing options per action
    - Updated SmartTimingOptions to properly sync with company settings
    - Added checkBusinessHours function to automation-executor edge function
    - Actions scheduled outside business hours are now deferred
  - Result: Business hours toggle now works correctly and persists properly

- **FIXED: Connect Page MessageContext Error** (July 22, 2025)
  - Issue: "useMessageContext must be used within MessageProvider" error on Connect page
  - Root cause: MessageProvider was missing from AppProviders component
  - Solution: Added MessageProvider import and wrapped providers properly in AppProviders.tsx
  - Result: Connect page now loads without context errors
- **FIXED: PageHeader Component Error** (July 22, 2025)  
  - Issue: "Element type is invalid" error in PageHeader component on Connect pages
  - Root cause: PageHeader component requires an 'icon' prop that was missing
  - Solution: Added icon={MessageSquare} prop to PageHeader in ConnectPage and ConnectCenterPage
  - Result: Connect pages now render properly without component errors
- **REMOVED: Connect Center Page** (August 3, 2025)
  - Removed `/connect-center` route and all related components
  - Using `/connect` as the unified communication hub
  - Deleted files:
    - `src/pages/ConnectCenterPage.tsx`
    - `src/pages/ConnectCenterPageOptimized.tsx`
    - `src/components/connect-center/` directory
  - Updated imports in:
    - `App.tsx` - removed ConnectCenterPage imports
    - `ComponentTest.tsx` - updated to use ConnectPage
    - `MessagesListWrapper.tsx` - updated NewConversationDialog import
  - Created `NewConversationDialog.tsx` in connect directory
  - All SMS functionality remains available in `/connect` page
  - Result: Cleaner codebase with single communication hub

- **VERIFIED: SMS System Fully Functional** (July 22, 2025)
  - **SMS Webhook**: Deployed with --no-verify-jwt flag at https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/sms-webhook
  - **Two-Way SMS**: Working properly - both inbound and outbound messages
  - **Database**: SMS conversations and messages are being stored correctly
  - **Phone Number**: +14375249932 configured and working
  - **Auto-Client Creation**: Unknown numbers automatically create client records
  - **Real-time Updates**: Messages appear instantly via SMSContext and realtime subscriptions
  - **Security**: Webhook uses Telnyx signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
  - **Current Status**: Fully operational - sending and receiving SMS messages successfully

- **FIXED: SMS Context Display Error** (July 2025)
  - Issue: SMSContext trying to display as React element when switching to Connect Center
  - Root cause: Incorrect import of SMSContext instead of SMSProvider
  - Solution: Import and use SMSProvider component properly in layout
  - Result: Connect Center SMS tab now loads without errors
- **FIXED: Send SMS Database Error** (July 2025)
  - Issue: Foreign key constraint violation when sending SMS
  - Root cause: sms_messages table had FK constraint to non-existent sms_conversation_messages
  - Solution: 
    - Dropped incorrect FK constraint
    - SMS messages now properly reference sms_conversations table
    - Updated Edge Function to handle message insertion properly
    - Don't throw errors on message insert failures (SMS already sent)
  - Result: SMS messages send correctly without database errors
- **FIXED: Estimate/Invoice Line Items Foreign Key Error** (July 2025)
  - Root cause: Edge functions were trying to query line_items table with foreign key relationship that doesn't exist
  - Estimates and invoices store items in JSONB column, not separate line_items table
  - Solution:
    - Updated send-estimate edge function to use JSONB items field
    - Updated send-invoice edge function to use JSONB items field
    - Added proper handling for different item field names (description/name, unit_price/rate/amount)
    - Added "No line items" message when items array is empty
  - Result: Estimate and invoice emails send successfully without database errors
- **FIXED: Two-Way SMS Implementation** (July 2025)
  - **Outbound SMS**: Already working via send-sms edge function
  - **Inbound SMS**: Fixed webhook configuration
  - Solution:
    - Deployed sms-webhook with `--no-verify-jwt` flag (required for external webhooks)
    - Added webhook signature verification for security
    - Auto-creates client records for unknown numbers
    - Creates conversations and tracks unread counts
  - **Production Security**:
    - JWT disabled is standard for webhooks (Stripe, Twilio, etc use same pattern)
    - Added Telnyx signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
    - Set TELNYX_WEBHOOK_SECRET in edge function secrets
    - Webhook only processes valid Telnyx payloads
  - Result: Full two-way SMS working in Connect Center
- **IMPLEMENTED: SMS Webhook Security** (July 2025)
  - **Production-Ready Configuration**:
    - JWT verification disabled (standard for webhooks)
    - Telnyx signature verification added
    - CORS headers configured
    - Request body validation
    - Error handling with proper status codes
  - **Security Features**:
    - Verifies telnyx-signature-ed25519 header
    - Validates timestamp to prevent replay attacks
    - Only processes valid Telnyx message payloads
    - Logs all operations for audit trail
  - **Auto-Client Creation**:
    - Unknown numbers create new client records
    - Sets appropriate defaults (individual, lead status)
    - Links conversations to client for tracking

### Technical Notes
- Uses Supabase edge functions for secure API key handling
- Implements proper error handling and retry logic
- Supports webhook callbacks for delivery confirmation and incoming messages
- All communications are logged for audit and debugging
- SMS conversations use database triggers to update last message and unread counts
- Context replaced MessageContext with SMSContext for cleaner implementation
- **Phone Number Format Requirements**:
  - Telnyx API requires E.164 format: `+` followed by country code and number
  - The `send-sms` Edge Function automatically formats phone numbers:
    - Removes all non-digit characters (spaces, dashes, parentheses)
    - Adds US country code (+1) if not present for 10-digit numbers
    - Validates final format matches E.164 pattern: `/^\+[1-9]\d{1,14}$/`
  - Always store phone numbers consistently in the database (preferably E.164)
  - Frontend can accept any format - conversion happens in the Edge Function
- **Unknown Number Handling**:
  - Webhook automatically creates client records for unknown numbers
  - Client type set to 'individual' with status 'lead'
  - Notes field documents auto-creation with timestamp
  - Conversations link to new client ID for proper tracking
  - All messages are logged with client metadata
- **Portal Token Security**:
  - All portal links now use secure random tokens (64 hex characters)
  - Tokens are generated using crypto.getRandomValues() for security
  - Tokens are stored in portal_access_token field in estimates/invoices tables
  - Portal routes validate token before displaying document
  - No direct ID exposure in URLs anymore
- **Webhook Security (Production)**:
  - JWT verification disabled is standard practice for webhooks
  - External services (Telnyx, Stripe, Twilio) cannot provide Supabase JWTs
  - Security implemented via:
    - HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
    - HTTPS only (enforced by Supabase)
    - Limited endpoint functionality
    - Request validation against Telnyx signature
  - TELNYX_WEBHOOK_SECRET must be set in edge function secrets
