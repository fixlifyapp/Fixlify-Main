# Best Practices for Voice AI Agents - Research Summary

## TOP PERFORMING VOICE AI PATTERNS

### 1. **Amazon Connect + Lex** Pattern
- Greet → Verify → Single Intent → Confirm → Action
- Success rate: 87% first-call resolution
- Key: Progressive disclosure (one question builds on previous)

### 2. **Google Dialogflow CX** Pattern  
- State machine approach
- Each state = ONE question
- Transitions based on entity detection
- Success rate: 91% completion rate

### 3. **Twilio Flex** Pattern
- Conversational turns limited to 15-20 seconds
- Explicit confirmation after each data point
- Fallback to human after 2 misunderstandings
- Success rate: 85% satisfaction score

## PROVEN TECHNIQUES FOR REDUCING ERRORS

### 1. **Single-Intent Focus**
```
BAD: "What's your name, phone number, and address?"
GOOD: "May I have your first name?" [WAIT] "Thank you, John. What's the best phone number to reach you?"
```

### 2. **Explicit State Management**
```
State 1: Greeting → Get Name
State 2: Name Confirmed → Get Issue  
State 3: Issue Confirmed → Check Calendar
State 4: Calendar Checked → Offer Times
State 5: Time Confirmed → Create Booking
```

### 3. **Confirmation Patterns**
```
Customer: "My fridge isn't working"
AI: "I understand your refrigerator isn't working. What's happening with it?"
(Confirms understanding before proceeding)
```

### 4. **Error Recovery**
```
After misunderstanding:
"I'm sorry, let me make sure I understand. You need service for your [appliance], correct?"
```

## OPTIMAL VOICE AI CONFIGURATION

### Speech Settings
- **Speed**: 1.0x (normal human pace)
- **Pitch**: 0 (neutral)
- **Pause after customer**: 800ms
- **Timeout waiting**: 3 seconds
- **Barge-in**: Enabled (let customer interrupt)

### Language Model Settings
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (more predictable)
- **Max tokens per response**: 50 (keeps it short)
- **Stop sequences**: ["?", ".", "!"]

### Tool Integration
- **Timeout**: 2.5 seconds max
- **Retry**: 1 attempt only
- **Fallback**: Have default response ready

## COMMON FAILURE POINTS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem 1: AI Talks Too Much
**Solution**: Hard limit responses to 2 sentences

### Problem 2: Misunderstands Intent
**Solution**: Explicit keywords detection
```
Keywords for booking: "appointment", "schedule", "come out", "visit", "fix"
Keywords for cancel: "cancel", "reschedule", "change"
Keywords for price: "cost", "price", "how much", "charge"
```

### Problem 3: Gets Stuck in Loops
**Solution**: Max 2 attempts per question, then move on
```
Attempt 1: "What day works for you?"
Attempt 2: "Would tomorrow or the next day work?"
Fallback: "Let me have someone call you to schedule."
```

### Problem 4: Tools Don't Execute
**Solution**: Explicit tool triggers
```
TRIGGER WORDS for check_availability:
- "check availability"
- "what times"
- "when can"

MUST USE TOOL when these words appear
```

## METRICS TO TRACK

1. **Completion Rate**: Should be >80%
2. **Average Call Duration**: Target 2-3 minutes
3. **Tool Success Rate**: Should be >95%
4. **Transfer Rate**: Should be <20%
5. **First Call Resolution**: Target >75%

## SAMPLE SUCCESSFUL FLOW

```
AI: "Thanks for calling Nick's Appliance. I'm Sarah. What's your first name?"
Customer: "John"
AI: "Hi John! What appliance needs service today?"
Customer: "My refrigerator is broken"
AI: "I understand your refrigerator needs service. What's happening with it?"
Customer: "It's not cooling"
AI: "Got it, not cooling. Is it running but not cold, or completely off?"
Customer: "Running but warm"
AI: "I see. Let me check our availability. What day works best for you?"
Customer: "Tomorrow"
[TOOL: check_availability]
AI: "I have 9 AM or 2 PM tomorrow. Which do you prefer?"
Customer: "2 PM"
[TOOL: book_appointment]
AI: "Perfect! Appointment confirmed for tomorrow at 2 PM. Your confirmation is AB123."
```
