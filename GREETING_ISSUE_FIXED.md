# ✅ FIXED: Greeting Variable Issue

## THE PROBLEM YOU HAD:
1. **First call:** Says "greeting" (literally the word)
2. **Second call:** Works correctly with "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair..."

## WHY THIS HAPPENED:
Telnyx was receiving `{{greeting}}` as a TEMPLATE instead of the actual processed text.

## WHAT I FIXED:

### 1. **PROCESSED THE GREETING**
The webhook now returns the FULLY PROCESSED greeting:
```
Before: "Thank you for calling {{company_name}}. I'm {{agent_name}}..."
After: "Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah..."
```

### 2. **ADDED ALL VARIABLES**
The webhook now returns ALL variables your prompt needs:
- ✅ agent_name
- ✅ company_name
- ✅ business_niche
- ✅ services_offered
- ✅ hours_of_operation
- ✅ diagnostic_fee
- ✅ additional_info
- ✅ is_existing_customer
- ✅ customer_name
- ✅ customer_history
- ✅ outstanding_balance
- ✅ call_transfer_message

### 3. **DISABLED CACHING**
Added headers to prevent any caching issues:
```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```

## YOUR TELNYX CONFIGURATION:
- **Webhook URL:** `https://mqppvcrlvsgrsqelglod.supabase.co/functions/v1/telnyx-dynamic-variables`
- **Greeting:** `{{greeting}}`

## WHAT CALLERS WILL HEAR (EVERY TIME):
```
"Thank you for calling Nicks appliance repair. I'm Sarah. Which appliance needs our attention today?"
```

## TEST IT:
Run `test-all-variables.js` in browser console to verify all variables are working.

## IF YOU STILL HEAR "GREETING" ON FIRST CALL:
This might be a Telnyx timing issue. Solutions:
1. Add a small delay in Telnyx before playing greeting
2. Or use a fallback greeting in Telnyx: "Hello, thanks for calling" 
3. Then let the AI take over with the full greeting

## STATUS: ✅ WEBHOOK FIXED
The webhook now returns the processed greeting and all required variables!
