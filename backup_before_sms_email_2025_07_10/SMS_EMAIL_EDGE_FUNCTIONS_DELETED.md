## Current State:
- âœ… **0 SMS/Email Edge Functions** remain in Supabase
- âœ… **Local project files** already cleaned (from previous cleanup)
- âœ… **Database tables** already removed (from previous cleanup)
- âœ… **UI placeholders** in place to prevent errors

## What's Left in Supabase:
Based on your screenshots, the remaining Edge Functions are NOT related to SMS/Email:
- AI and automation functions
- Report generation
- Client portal functions
- Document management
- Other business logic

## Next Steps:
1. Refresh your Supabase dashboard to confirm all SMS/Email functions are gone
2. The system is now completely clean and ready for fresh SMS/Email implementation
3. When you're ready to implement new SMS/Email functionality:
   - Design your architecture first
   - Create new Edge Functions with clear naming
   - Implement step by step with proper testing

## Important Note:
All the remaining Edge Functions in your Supabase dashboard (like `generate-with-ai`, `notifications`, `reports-run`, etc.) are **NOT** SMS/Email related and should be kept as they handle other parts of your application.

The SMS/Email system has been completely removed from both local files and Supabase! ðŸŽ‰
