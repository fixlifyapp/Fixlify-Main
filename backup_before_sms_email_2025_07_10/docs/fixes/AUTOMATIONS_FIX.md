# Fix for Automations Page

## The Issues:

1. **Nothing happens when clicking buttons** - This is because the components are trying to load but there might be missing dependencies or components
2. **No data showing** - The page needs authenticated user data

## Quick Fix:

Add this to your browser console while on the automations page:

```javascript
// Check if you're logged in
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current user:', user);

// If logged in, check for workflows
if (user) {
  const { data: workflows } = await supabase
    .from('automation_workflows')
    .select('*')
    .eq('organization_id', user.id);
  console.log('Your workflows:', workflows);
}
```

## What's Happening:

1. When you click "Create Automation", it should show a dialog with two options:
   - Start with a Template
   - Build from Scratch

2. The components are all there:
   - `VisualWorkflowBuilder` - For building from scratch
   - `SmartTemplateGallery` - For choosing templates
   - `AutomationsList` - For showing your automations

## To Use the App:

1. **Make sure you're logged in** - The automations need a user session
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
3. **Try refreshing the page** after logging in

## How organization_id works in your app:

- When you create an automation, it's linked to your user account
- The system uses `organization_id` to group automations by company
- For single users, `organization_id` = `user_id`
- For teams, multiple users can share the same `organization_id`

The automation system is ready to use - it just needs you to be logged in!
