# Job Creation Error Fix Summary

## Issue
When clicking "Create Job", the browser shows "ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES" errors due to:
1. Multiple concurrent job fetch requests
2. Real-time subscriptions triggering rapid refreshes
3. Missing or null `user_id` in profiles causing query failures

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Profile Data Issues
- Updated all profiles to have `user_id` set (was null for some users)
- Updated profile creation trigger to always set `user_id = id`
- Added default `organization_id` for new users

### 2. Disabled Problematic Features (Temporary)
- Disabled real-time updates in JobsPageOptimized
- Disabled automation triggers temporarily
- Added refresh throttling to prevent rapid refreshes

### 3. Added Safeguards
- Created `RefreshThrottler` utility to limit refresh frequency
- Added concurrent request prevention in job creation
- Fixed profile creation to ensure proper role assignment

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Database Issue**: `user_id` was null in profiles, causing queries to fail
2. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Multiple subscriptions causing cascade of refreshes
3. **Automation Triggers**: Still investigating potential loops

## Testing
You can test simple job creation in the browser console:
```javascript
await testSimpleJobCreation()
```

## Next Steps
1. Re-enable real-time updates with proper debouncing
2. Re-enable automation triggers with better safeguards
3. Add monitoring for resource usage
4. Implement global request limiting

## Immediate Workaround
The app should now work for job creation with:
- Real-time updates disabled
- Automation triggers disabled
- Refresh throttling enabled

Try creating a job now - it should work without errors.
