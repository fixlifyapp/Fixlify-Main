# Automations Page - Complete Fix Summary

## ✅ Completed Fixes:

1. **Performance Page** - Now shows proper metrics and charts
2. **AI Assistant Tab** - Renamed from "Help & Tips" and integrated with OpenAI
3. **Missing Services** - Created `communicationService` with triggers and actions
4. **Property Name Fixes** - Changed `run_count` to `execution_count` everywhere

## 🔧 Still Need to Fix:

### 1. Template Selection Flow
When clicking "Use This Template" in the template gallery:
- Should open the Visual Workflow Builder with the template pre-loaded
- Currently shows a blank page

Need to make it work on all screen sizes:
- Mobile: Stack sidebar at bottom
- Tablet: Side-by-side with smaller sidebar
